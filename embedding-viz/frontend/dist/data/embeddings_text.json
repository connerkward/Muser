This inefficiency, an economy not well organized to effectively employ surplus labor, is a common feature of pre-modern economies, creating a ready supply of people desperate enough to do things like work in the mines merely to eat.\n\n**ROME** \nWhy Brutus failed the republic \nI was reading stuff about alchemy years ago, and they mention mine regeneration belief. Some of it was that the distinction between living matter and non-living matter didn\u2019t exist in the way it does now. Mines were \u201calive\u201d, sort of, because the Earth was. Like how you always hear about how alchemist either wanted to make gold or to make potions of immortality. To alchemists, these weren\u2019t two different things, it was just about creating perfect versions of living stuff.\n\nTo the majority of Romans, the notion that their government represented them, allowed full accountability and participation was laughable. The government was in the hands of an indifferent elite, leeching off the glory, riches and power of the republic on the backs of thousands of plebs who worked for it. The majority of Romans must have been disillusioned with their government, and even before Caesar and Sulla became dictators, they must have felt like they were loosing their liberty anyways.\nWhen Caesar, the charismatic, renowned, rich, politically astute aristocrat declares his support for the people against the\u00a0*Optimates\u00a0*they fall in love with him. When he becomes consul and passes the land reform bill, distributing public lands to citizens to farm via lottery this makes him popular as well.\n\n**DESERT IRRIGATION**\nQanat - Persian design to keep water underground between aquifer so that it won't evaporate and salt the earth\nCivilization emerges by irrigation \nABU DHABI\nUses of wind capture, from traditional arab architecture design\nWind Funneling\nShade creation\nShikka Urban Wind tunnels\n\n**MAYAN CALENDAR**\nMaya had 18 20 day periods that made a year \nBase 20 number system \nHave underground rivers that are accessed by sinkholes \nMaya did not human sacrifice as much as Aztec \nMaya human sacrifice increased as they declined \n\n**DOGGERLAND SEA LEVEL RISE**\nseeing the oceans rise miles inland over the course of a century due to it being a giant floodplain \nCulture develops that thinks the entire world will eventually be consumed by water \n\n**TOUCHSTONES**\n\nTouchstone to compare stock metal and the metal in question by rubbing and comparing colors, using a ring on the touchstone\nAlso using acid to dissolve lesser materials in gold \n\nINTERNMENT \nFor Japanese internment camps only 1/16 blood of Japanese dissent was needed also the camps were instituted by the military governor of the West Coast not by president executive order\n\n**HERUCULANEIUM / POMPEII **\n\nat pompeii, wood and bones decayed. at heruculaneum, they survived\n\n**ROME - SIEGE LAW**\n\nAccording to roman law, as soon as the first ram hit the city gates, the defenders lost any rights\n\n**ALEXANDRIA - SCHOLARS**\n\nScholar society\nTook all books that arrived on shore and gave owners copies back\nMuses -> Museon -> Museum\nCan address the scholars directly, duty as public intellectuals \nTax exemptions and slaves\nAsked for loan of book for deposit, instead kept the original and gave back a copy and let other keep deposit \nLibraries are starting become competitive in the region \nKept originals because they liked to compare originals to compare for deviations and errors\n\u201cCritical Editions\u201d \n\n**MONGOLS / VENICE - SIEGE ENGINEERS**\t\nmONGOLS IN VADE EUOPE, DEVELOPED GOOD SIEGE ENGINEERS FIGHTING CHINA,", "timestamp": 1605570170, "umap": [-1.7282618284225464, 9.184431076049805], "cluster": 23}, {"id": "Parenting Notes", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/PARENTING/Parenting Notes.md", "preview": "# Parenting Notes\n\n## Parenting Notes \n- Ask your kids when they lie what they think should happens to liars \n\n", "full_text": "# Parenting Notes\n\n## Parenting Notes \n- Ask your kids when they lie what they think should happens to liars \n\n", "timestamp": 1606708953, "umap": [3.348356008529663, 9.243318557739258], "cluster": 6}, {"id": "FAST SEX SLOW LOVE helen fisher", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/PARENTING/FAST SEX SLOW LOVE helen fisher.md", "preview": "# FAST SEX SLOW LOVE helen fisher\n\nFAST SEX SLOW LOVE helen fisher \nhelen fisher believes that one night stands and living together without marriage is because of a culture shift. people are afraid of", "full_text": "# FAST SEX SLOW LOVE helen fisher\n\nFAST SEX SLOW LOVE helen fisher \nhelen fisher believes that one night stands and living together without marriage is because of a culture shift. people are afraid of divorce, both the economic and social fallout, and are not showing more caution.

Mission Gone Awry\nOn a recon scouting mission west of Quang Ngai, our HMM-362 UH34D was targeted by an enemy 12.7mm nesting in a landscape of B-52 mud holes.\nThe 12.7 sounded like a .45 going off inches from my helmet. The crew chief yells, \u201cThey\u2019re shooting at us, sir!\u201d I was already doing evasive maneuvers, and got us out of there. We had to wonder where it was, and how they operated from those mud holes.\nWe had a single passenger, a senior Intel Marine scouting for upcoming insert and retraction zones for his Force Recon teams. He quickly let the crew chief know he wanted to take control of our flight path, telling the crew chief to tell me to \u201cfly back over that area\u201d.\nI was pilot in command, and not about to do that. We were a single unaccompanied chopper with no backup way out in the boonies. We had just been almost shot out the sky by a large caliber weapon while at 3,000\u2019 agl.\nMy hazy legal memory from flight training in Pensacola recalled that in situations such as this the airborne pilot maintains command, even over a senior officer, relating to safety-of-flight issues....unless the senior officer gives a direct order.\nI instantly told the crew chief, \u201cPut him on the mike!\u201d (To this day, I don\u2019t know where this wild thought came from except some mischievous Irish ancestor).\n\u201cYou want me to give him my helmet?\u201d \u201cNo, the one between my legs!\u201d\n\u201cBut sir, but but....that\u2019s your piss tube!\u201d \u201cYes, please give it to the Colonel.\u201d\nIt had a neat spread lip that made it look like an old time megaphone on a hanging cord, and we pilots used it while flying, or more normally, on the ground, during hot refueling. It hung between our legs, and it sure could be mistaken for a communication device. It was also long enough to stretch rearward into the main H-34 cabin.\nThe Colonel spoke into the piss tube. He was apparently too intent on his mission to notice any smell! However, since I never got his orders, I didn\u2019t have to obey them!\nWe did not re-fly over that 12.7 mud hole, though.\nWe dropped the Colonel off near the Chu Lai TAOR, then on to Ky Ha, where the crew laughed our tails off because he never knew what went down!\nCaptain Don Funk, USMCR RVN 1966-67\nHAC HMM-362\nFAC/ALO 7th Marines\n", "timestamp": 1620362657, "umap": [-1.6459708213806152, 10.878939628601074], "cluster": 13}, {"id": "Japan tanks", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/GEO-MOMENTS/Japan tanks.md", "preview": "# Japan tanks \n\n- Were smaller because they were training to fight against the inferior armed Chinese warlords\n- Needed tanks small enough to pontoon over unimproved river crossings and inside ships \n", "full_text": "# Japan tanks \n\n- Were smaller because they were training to fight against the inferior armed Chinese warlords\n- Needed tanks small enough to pontoon over unimproved river crossings and inside ships \n\n", "timestamp": 1623445520, "umap": [-1.6709543466567993, 10.363716125488281], "cluster": 13}, {"id": "North Korea", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/GEO-MOMENTS/North Korea.md", "preview": "# North Korea\n- History was forgotten \n- Ideas of liberty, human rights, race, did not exist \n- // seems like traveling through time really \n- Humans are so adaptable that there are no base morals\n- O", "full_text": "# North Korea\n- History was forgotten \n- Ideas of liberty, human rights, race, did not exist \n- // seems like traveling through time really \n- Humans are so adaptable that there are no base morals\n- Once the king had attained godhood, it is not longer falsifiable.

Of course, falling in at about only 300 pages, The Forever War is a short novel. The sense of melancholia and trudger throughout the galaxy adds to this slow build but feels like it never amounts to anything great (which I suppose is the purpose of the novel, that wars leads to nothing). The Taurans design was also not to my liking. They weren't as interesting as they could have been, but there are reasons for everything I disagree about. I would argue that The Forever War isn't really a military science fiction novel that focusses on the military, but rather the war and the somewhat poor hard science fiction. The military is primitive, use no air support or APC\u2019s, rather building bases and sitting inside them.

Highlighting China's own reliance on space-based capabilities should be a part of a tailored deterrence strategy.\u201d\n\n// My prediction is the viability of satellite warfare will increase and therefore human habitation of low earth orbit will decrease in the coming decades\n\n\u201cthe United States needs to continue to develop and demonstrate an ability to attribute attacks on its space systems in order to establish credible and assured retaliation.13 The importance of devel- oping these capabilities is reflected in the increasing prioritization of space domain awareness (SDA) in the USSF and United States Space Command.14\u201d\n\n\u201cChina may seek to establish a legitimacy for its own actions in space by messaging that the United States has already violated the peaceful use of space. One primary source document asserts that the establishment of USSF is one such example of a violation of the international system of the peaceful use of space.18\u201d\n\n\u201cChina could also engage in a messaging campaign that attempts to divide the United States from its allies by asserting that USSF is engaging in destabilizing activities that it has not disclosed to these allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, the United States might seek ways of demonstrating that it is not as highly dependent on satellite-enabled warfare as Beijing has come to believe in recent years. As discussed above, China assesses that U.S. satellites were an essential enabler of Washington\u2019s successful joint military operations against Iraq. In order to modify Chinese percep- tions that the United States is heavily reliant on space and therefore reduce Beijing\u2019s focus on space deterrence, Washington could publicly reveal new capabilities outside of the space domain, such as advanced surveillance remote piloted vehicles or new communications systems, which demonstrate redundancy of its space-based capabilities. Devel- oping and messaging the existence of this redundancy could encour- age China to reconsider the value of taking escalatory steps in space. From this perspective, the establishment of USSF is counterproduc- tive because the new service implies that Beijing is correct\u2014that is, that the United States does highly value outer space and must defend it at all costs to avoid vulnerabilities on Earth.\u201d\n\n// Contrary to what I said previously, in the short term it actually behooves us as the dominant power in space to put more humans\n\n// As an act of space debris deterrence\n\n/However I think as the danger becomes more apparently policy makers will decrease it\n", "timestamp": 1647513802, "umap": [-1.7625383138656616, 9.211644172668457], "cluster": 23}, {"id": "Bush - Stub", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Bush - Stub.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2022-03-17T03:44:27-07:00\nupdated: 2022-03-17T03:44:27-07:00\n---\n# Bush - Stub\nCabinet was Neo-conservative bunch\n\nEnded the American long standing tradition of having the another party m", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2022-03-17T03:44:27-07:00\nupdated: 2022-03-17T03:44:27-07:00\n---\n# Bush - Stub\nCabinet was Neo-conservative bunch\n\nEnded the American long standing tradition of having the another party member in cabinet", "timestamp": 1647513867, "umap": [-1.0783305168151855, 9.623774528503418], "cluster": 25}, {"id": "Techno Authoritarian Skepticism", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Techno Authoritarian Skepticism.md", "preview": "# Techno Authoritarian Skepticism \n[**Yuval Noah Harari**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmQqBX6Dn4)\ncreated:: 2022-02-25\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmQqBX6Dn4](https://www.youtube.com/watc", "full_text": "# Techno Authoritarian Skepticism \n[**Yuval Noah Harari**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmQqBX6Dn4)\ncreated:: 2022-02-25\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmQqBX6Dn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmQqBX6Dn4)\n\nRallying against techno-authoritarianism is an older form, and at least for me whats being said here is an older form of similar ideas. What zuboff instead emphasizes to a greater degree is stepping back and recontextualizing techno-utopian narratives, as derived from what was stated directly by those in power (CEO's, politicians), taken to logical extremes  \nhe does bring up a similar point to zuboff in that there are asymmetries of awareness over the true magnitude of big data  \nwhile similar in that (techo-dystopian prevention vs techno-utopian skepticism) are sort of inverses of each other, the latter is a different perspective, because it involves less other-izing. It is not a looming threat, but is already fundamentally integrated into our daily lives, just in the past decades phrased publicly in mostly positive terms.  \n  \nCurrently we are of course of the downslope of cyclical techno-optimism, moving into 70's-esque techno-pessimism  \n\nI really like his way of using the data lens of analysis  \n  \nthat democracy / market based information processing was more efficient that authoritarian regimes given the technology  \n  \nI the data lens of analysis, there is however in this a blind spot I think.

I do not think this is obvious, nor a given.  \n  \nI am skeptical because it feels similar to 20th century regimes that also claimed they could rule directly efficiently due to their at the time advanced technology (mechanization, mass communication), and people in the west also feared it.  \n  \nNow, it may be that current technology IS sufficient to bring about techno-authoritarianism.

Here, even those who own less than an acre could achieve viable farming simply by extending an agricultural product's potential so that its saleability is enhanced.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_agriculture#cite_note-:0-3)\u00a0For example, if a producer farms strawberries, he should not only sell the crop as fresh berries since he could also profit from its other portions by producing other products such as strawberry jelly and syrup.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_agriculture#cite_note-:0-3)\n\nAccording to the study, value-added agriculture allows farmers to capture as much as 80 percent of the value of most of their agricultural produce.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_agriculture#cite_note-5)\n\nThis concept has gained currency in the\u00a0[small farm policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Small_farm_policy&action=edit&redlink=1)\u00a0debate, in response to the concern that the farm value of the consumer food dollar continues to decrease. Value-added agriculture might be a means for farmers to capture a larger share of the consumer food dollar. Examples include\u00a0[direct marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_marketing); farmer ownership of processing facilities; and producing farm products with a higher intrinsic value (such as\u00a0[identity-preserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity-preserved)\u00a0grains,\u00a0[organic produce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_product),\u00a0[organic beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_beef),\u00a0[free-range chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-range_chicken); etc.), for which buyers are willing to pay a higher price than for more traditional bulk commodities. The key for the higher returns is the high-demand in\u00a0[product niches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market)\u00a0and this is demonstrated in the popularity of products such as garlic braids, bagged salad mix, artisan bread, lavender soaps, and sausages, among others.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_agriculture#cite_note-:2-1)\n\nValue-added agriculture is regarded by some as a significant rural development strategy. In the United States, this is considered a way for producers not only to increase their income but also compete with commodity marketers and upstream processors.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_agriculture#cite_note-:1-4)\u00a0Small-scale, organic food processing, non-traditional crop production,\u00a0[agri-tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agri-tourism), and\u00a0[bio-fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-fuels)\u00a0development are examples of various value-added projects that have also created new jobs in some rural places.

Pain in the ass. While navigating the crummy, hidden folders to recover weirdly-sounding filenames\u2026 an epiphany hit me \u2014\u00a0_The File_\u00a0is dying. The metaphorical role of a file is dying. The file used to be the beginning and the end \u2014 it contained an essay, a book, a photo, a song, a todo list, a business card\u2026 to give you a document I would put the file containing it on a disk. Or on a usb stick. Or I would send it via email.\n\nThe piece of information\u00a0**was**\u00a0the file and vice versa: the file\u00a0**was**\u00a0the piece of information.\n\nBut not so much anymore. The email program does not operate on files. Neither does the twitter client nor the todo-tracking application. They store data in well-hidden databases in the internal directories that we\u2019re not supposed to look at. And quite rightly \u2014 because there is nothing to see there. Looking at the huge\u00a0_photos.db_\u00a0one might only wonder where his dog photos are.\n\nSure, the applications still give you a way to share things and take them out of the storage. You can export a contact out of your address book as a vcard file. But the role of\u00a0_The File_\u00a0here is slowly being reduced to a role of an intermediate storage medium. The business card is temporarily put in the\u00a0_.vcf_\u00a0file before it gets injected into somebody else\u2019s database (another address book?).\n\nAs more and more applications operate on databases, the computer is becoming a monolithic\u00a0_black-box_\u00a0that \u201chas things\u201d. How exactly (and where) the data is stored is becoming less clear. The application and the interface becomes united with the user data. It becomes one.\n\nAnd if I own your user interface, I own your data.\n\n**Not so good**\n\nDatabases as storage mediums solve problems by creating new ones.\n\nI've got a directory on my disk that contains stuff related to my\u00a0[company](http://www.new-wild.com/)\u00a0\u2013 documents, invoices and some other content which is still mostly file-based. But I also have a todo list related to my work things and some notes about current projects. These are stored in two separate applications that operate on their own storage. So now: if I copy the whole company directory to another medium I'm not effectively copying everything. This trivial issue is extremely confusing for most users who are not familiar with the application internals.\n\nThere are other technical issues as well. Apple\u2019s\u00a0[Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/time-machine.html)\u00a0is a good example here. It\u2019s a great backup service but it was designed to operate on files. When a file is modified locally Time Machine copies it to a backup storage. This way it\u2019s fast and incremental \u2013 the changes are small and isolated. You can even browse various versions of the file from the past. But if your \u201cfile\u201d is a monolithic 1GB notes & pictures database (it\u2019s \u201ceverything\u201d) the whole concept is blown away (ie.\u00a0[Yojimbo](http://www.mail-archive.com/yojimbo-talk@barebones.com/msg01151.html)\u00a0example).\n\n**Meet the service**\n\nNot surprisingly, we stopped talking \u201cfiles\u201d long time ago. We\u2019re talking \u201cservices\u201d now. In some cases it works great: in example, I don\u2019t exactly care how my Linux, Mac or iPhone email client store the mail data. I don\u2019t care because the central storage (my IMAP server) is out there and it has a clear, well-defined service API. It\u2019s transparent.\n\nToo bad that email is a lonely exception here. Quite a significant portion of the data generated by us today is put in totally black-boxed, closed services that are very open to\u00a0_take_\u00a0our data but not very keen on\u00a0_giving it back_\u00a0in a sane way. This is often a deliberate business practice but sometimes \u2013 a lack of thought.

Searle claims \u201cSyntax is not sufficient for semantics,\u201d however I argue that this is a relative function of syntax as semantics is also a relative variable. As one comprehends more syntax, possibly from other domains, they increase in semantic understanding. However, \u201ctrue understanding\u201d as an infinite, unreachable end state of semantics, can only be approached towards infinity, it can never be reached. However, this means pragmatically that we can in fact create a machine that understands semantics at the level in which we assume a human does (we assume the human is the end state), just by increasing levels of syntactical understanding. Just as we in the 3rd dimension can visually contextualize a 4rth dimensional cube by reduction to 3 dimensions, we never can truly \u201cunderstand\u201d in the 4rth dimensional perception of the 4d cube, however we can approach understanding. Effectively, this means that through syntax we can comprehend and therefore act upon (mathematically in this case) n dimensional objects. However, assuming that we can never perceive them, we will never reach semantic \u201ctrue understanding\u201d, despite pragmatically approaching all functions on them by reduction and expansion, or projection. \n\nCognitive scientist Margaret Boden argues in [1] that the human brain is not the carrier of intelligence, but rather that it\u00a0_causes_intelligence. Analogously, the person in the room\u00a0_causes_\u00a0an understanding of Chinese to arise, even though it does not understand Chinese itself.\n\nCulmulative Syntax = The sum of ((level of syntax n)+(level of syntax (n+1))+\u2026..)/n where n equals the domains of syntactical knowledge\n\nAs Culmulative Syntax approaches infinite syntax, it also approaches infinite semantics (true understanding).\n\nSemantics are a function of cumulative, relative syntax \n\nSemantics in a domain D = D*semanticleveofD+AnotherDomainD2*semanticleveofD2+\u2026\n\nSelection of domains <- indeterminate, needs to be something that the more relevant the domains the larger semantics of domain d emerges\n\nContinuum of all domains (assuming domains are discrete)\n\n  \nA neuron does not understand anything, just as the Chinese room does not.

It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could've remained unharmed by it. (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations)\n\nChoose not to be harmed, and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed, and you haven't been. (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations)\n\nSoon you'll be ashes, or bones. A mere name at most, and even that is just a sound, an echo. (Motivation to live.)\n\nThen what should we work for? Only this: proper understanding, unselfish action, truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring. (Good life goals.)\n\n\u201cThe object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.\u201d\n\n_Questionable for a given definition of \u201cinsane\u201d_\n\n\u201cHow much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.\u201d\n\n## Seneca\nAssociate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach.\n\nSelf-contented as he is, then, he does need friends - and wants as many of them as possible - but not to enable him to lead a happy life. This he will have even without friends. The supreme ideal does not call for any external aids, it is homegrown and entirely self-developed. Once it starts looking outside itself for any part of itself, it is on the way to being dominated by Fortune. (Seneca, Letters from a Stoic)\n\n\u00a0\"Not growing up with a father figure\" issue.

Everything has cause, and no thing can cause itself to exist. God is the only thing exempt from this. Scientifically, however, the beginning fo the universe suggests that things we can no longer interact with can be the cause or previously inter actable with things. However, I do not agree with Aquinas\u2019 notion that causes can not infinitely regress. We can not comprehend infinity in it\u2019s true extent, but there are no reasons why something can not infinitely regress. By a similar notion, this suggests that God could have been a cause given God has a cause that which can indeed infinitely regress. However, on the subject of the contingency, I do agree that given our understanding of the universe, we must be able to comprehend the concept that there must never have been a time of nothing because nothing can not spontaneously become something without a cause (nor be its own cause).\n\n\u201cThe claim could be made that God has a \u201chigher morality\u201d by which his actions are to be judged. But it is a strange \u201chigher morality\u201d which claims that what we call \u201cbad\u201d is good and what we call \u201cgood\u201d is bad.\u201d\n\nOn the subject of evil I disagree with the text\u2019s assumption that God\u2019s \u201cHigher Morality\u201d \u201chas no meaning to us.\u201d Given that God exists and that he has a grasp of \u201chigher morality\u201d, it may have limited meaning to us but not no meaning. Because we can never know destiny or time beyond our own, the text may assume that on large scales some grand plan of morality may not have effect on us, however, that does not mean we can not try to conceptualize it as so. \n\nTeleological does not make sense, why would something that appear too designed actually be? Statistically with enough repetitions anything can emerge. I do not think this follows because it relies on an human inability to comprehend large numbers.

In other words, we are urged to believe that\u00a0[Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)'s theory of ideals is an\u00a0[abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction), divorced from the so-called external world, of modern European philosophy, despite the fact Plato taught that ideals are ultimately real, and different from non-ideal things\u2014indeed, he argued for a distinction between the ideal and non-ideal realm.\n\nMotive Utilitarianism states that our initial moral task is to inculcate motives within ourselves (by means of teaching and repetition) that will be generally useful across the spectrum of the actual situations we are likely to encounter, rather than hypothetical examples which are unlikely to occur. It can be thought of as a hybrid between Act and Rule Utilitarianism, but it also attempts to take into account how human beings actually function psychologically.\n\nTwo-Level Utilitarianism states that normally we should use \"intuitive\" moral thinking, in the form of Rule Utilitarianism, because it usually maximizes happiness. However, there are some times when we must ascend to a higher \"critical\" level of reflection in order to decide what to do, and must think as an Act Utilitarian would. This method is based on the view that, although Act Utilitarianism may be preferable in theory, usually it is too difficult to perfectly predict consequences, and so we require moral guidelines or rules in day to day life.", "timestamp": 1647563944, "umap": [0.7954848408699036, 11.106205940246582], "cluster": 17}, {"id": "Stoics", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Stoics.md", "preview": "# Stoics\n#philosophy \n\nModern Stoicism arose as part of the late 20th century surge of interest in\u00a0[virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics). \"The [...] work by philosophers like\u00a0[P", "full_text": "# Stoics\n#philosophy \n\nModern Stoicism arose as part of the late 20th century surge of interest in\u00a0[virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics). \"The [...] work by philosophers like\u00a0[Philippa Foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Foot),\u00a0[Alasdair MacIntyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alasdair_MacIntyre), and\u00a0[Martha Nussbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum), among others, have brought back virtue ethics as a viable alternative to the dominant\u00a0[Kantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics)\u2013[deontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics)\u00a0and\u00a0[utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism)\u2013[consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism)\u00a0approaches.\"[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Stoicism#cite_note-PigliucciIEP-2)\n\nThe Development of\u00a0[Virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue)\u00a0[happens through] the Perfection of Agency,\"[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Stoicism#cite_note-Becker-5)\u00a0or through the \"ideal agency\"[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Stoicism#cite_note-Becker-5)\u00a0as he calls it.

As he describes it: \"By undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort \u2013 by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed \u2013 we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befell us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future.\"[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Stoicism#cite_note-:1-27)\n\nIn Stoicism, it is our interpretation of events that causes us to be happy or unhappy, not any intrinsic quality of the events.

Four decades later, Eric Horvitz, director of Microsoft Research, concurred: \u201cRight now, what we are doing is not a science but a kind of alchemy\u201d [86].

There's no way to fix it. \"Just try and get someone to come and make repairs,\" laments the Union, N.J., resident. \"They may come in once, but they never come back.\"\n\nThat's because Chumsky's innocent-looking suburban residence is a handyman's nightmare. It also stands as a monument to one of the most colossal flops in the history of scientific innovation. It is one of a dozen surviving examples of Thomas Edison's worst invention ever: the single-piece cast-concrete house.\n\nEdison's concrete houses aren't quite as well-known as, say, the incandescent bulb, the phonograph, or the motion picture. Yet the great inventor devoted nearly as much time and effort to them as he did to any of his better-known discoveries. He even dreamt of a future in which millions of Americans would not only live in concrete houses, but also sleep on concrete beds, and play music on concrete pianos.\n\nIt was a classic case of one failure begetting another. In the late 1880s, Edison had turned to perfecting a new process for refining iron ore using magnets and massive crushing rollers. The enterprise wasted more than a decade of effort and several million dollars. But instead of selling the equipment for scrap and calling it a day, the redoubtable Edison decided to use the huge rollers to manufacture high-grade cement.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220317183137.png]]\n\nBy 1906, four years after its opening, the cement plant, too, had become a money pit. But if no one wanted his cement, the Wizard of Menlo Park declared, he would create his own demand.\n\nThat August, in an after-dinner speech in New York City, Edison announced his latest brainchild to the world. Concrete homes, he said, would revolutionize American life. They would be fireproof, insect-proof, easy to clean. The walls could be pre-tinted in attractive colors and would never need to be repainted. Everything from shingles to bathtubs to picture frames would be cast as a single monolith of concrete, in a process that took just a few hours. Extra stories could be added with a simple adjustment of the molding forms. Best of all, the $1,200-dollar houses would be cheap enough for even the poorest slum-dwellers to afford.\n\nScarcely less extravagant were the claims of Edison's admirers. \"The time will most certainly come when whole houses will be turned out in one piece,\" a biographer declared in 1907. When the molds were removed, he wrote, \"a solid and almost bomb-proof house will be left behind.\"\n![[Pasted image 20220317183149.png]]\nBecause New Jersey has not yet been subjected to extensive bombardment, the veracity of that statement is hard to test. In nearly every other respect, however, Edison's early prototypes proved disastrous. Instead of simple molds, the houses required nickel-plated iron forms containing more than two thousand parts and weighing nearly half a million pounds. A builder had to buy at least $175,000 in equipment before pouring a single house. Furthermore, nobody wanted to live in a residence that had been dubbed \"the salvation of the slum dweller.\" Although Edison optimistically described an early model as \"in the style of Francois I,\" it was more in the style of an oversized outhouse.\n\nUndaunted, Edison announced that he was generously turning his invention over, free, to anyone who wanted to help humanity. Building contractors didn't exactly beat a path to his door. So in 1911, the inventor made another go of it. This time, he announced, he had discovered a product line for which concrete was ideally suited: home furnishings.\n\nUsing special lightweight \"foam concrete,\" Edison proposed the manufacture of concrete phonograph cabinets and concrete pianos.

In effect, innocence breeds complacency and becomes the agent of its own destruction. It makes the indulgent vulnerable to their enemies, unaware of what is at stake. Only after innocence is overcome can it be regained and passed on to future generations. The generations that fought the two World Wars and then the Cold War lost their innocence so that subsequent generations could retain theirs. Paradoxically, a generation with no knowledge of war, with its innocence intact, might not appreciate what it has. \u2018Freedom isn\u2019t free,\u2019 is the resounding message of\u00a0_Red Dawn_. The cost of freedom requires the periodic sacrificing of childlike innocence, at both the personal and collective level, and the cultivation of a sense of responsibility and vigilant defense of what one has. Otherwise, one will be left lamenting, like Jed and Matt\u2019s father from behind the internment camp fence, \u201cOne way or another\u2026for one reason or another\u2026we\u2019re all gone\u2026it\u2019s all gone.\u201d", "timestamp": 1647568154, "umap": [-0.454515665769577, 10.337191581726074], "cluster": 26}, {"id": "Thoughts on BMW Future", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Thoughts on BMW Future.md", "preview": "# Thoughts on BMW Future\n#future #predictions #bmw #apple #iot #tech\n2021-08-18\n-   Apple car is not a bad idea (I thought it was a bad idea previously)\n-   Apple and Google exert influence by making ", "full_text": "# Thoughts on BMW Future\n#future #predictions #bmw #apple #iot #tech\n2021-08-18\n-   Apple car is not a bad idea (I thought it was a bad idea previously)\n-   Apple and Google exert influence by making it harder for car OEM's to integrate their services with phones, like the Airtag and CarPlay one press integration vs multiple presses into BMW app \n-   Therefore - bmw may not have long term prospects, much like phone OEM's shifted from having their own OS's to skinning android for differentiation to not being able to differentiate today\n-   Tech stacks can be made unsustainable by powers like google who can pump out killer features and people like BMW are unable to keep up\n-   BMW will have to eventually capitulate to android auto or CarPlay or Apple whatever or they will unable to be able to keep with \"google phone\" like features, reducing their value proposition (which to be fair is less of an issue for luxury brands) when users start realizing \"hey why can Jon's phone do X and my car can not\"\n-   I understand that the company wants to keep its autonomy", "timestamp": 1647568227, "umap": [-0.04139556735754013, 7.608509540557861], "cluster": 19}, {"id": "How to Make Whiskey", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/How to Make Whiskey.md", "preview": "# How to Make Whiskey\n#alcohol/whiskey \n\n2021-08-28\n\n**The Whiskey Process**\n\nMalted Rye, Flaked Corn, \n\n1.

Computer science is a grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have people working on something like the natural history of computers-- studying the behavior of algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. And then at the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters. It's as if mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same department. \n\nSometimes what the hackers do is called \"software engineering,\" but this term is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do, and engineers figure out how to do it. \n\nPerhaps one day \"computer science\" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its component parts. That might be a good thing. Especially if it meant independence for my native land, hacking. \n\nThe mathematicians don't seem bothered by this. They happily set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says \\`\\`computer science'' on the outside. But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers. \n\nUnfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the best subjects for papers. Number one, research must be original-- and as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to be sure that you're exploring virgin territory is to to stake out a piece of ground that no one wants. \n\nIn the best case, the papers are just a formality. Hackers write cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software. But often this mismatch causes problems. It's easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers. \n\nAll the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feeling in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory, and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all that stuff within three weeks of the final exam. \n\nFor example, I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer. I found that I did not program this way. I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper. Worse still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape. \n\n  \n\nDebugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights. The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging. \n\nFor a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn't hold my pencil the way they taught me to in elementary school. If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong.

It was bad enough when they were motionless; but when they started to move, and sympathetic vibrations set in, it was more than any warm-blooded male should be asked to take. He was quite sure that at least one serious space accident had been caused by acute crew distraction, after the transit of a well-upholstered lady officer through the control cabin.\n```\n\"simps\" are monkeys\n```\nFor this reason, affairs spanning more than two degrees of rank were firmly discouraged; but apart from this, the only rule regulating shipboard sex was 'So long as they don't do it in the corridors and frighten the simps'.\n```\n\n```\nEach weighed less than thirty kilos and consumed only half the food and oxygen of a human being, but each could replace 2.75 men for housekeeping, elementary cooking, tool-carrying and dozens of other routine jobs.\n```\n\n```\nThat 2.75 was the Corporation's claim, based on innumerable time-and-motion studies. The figure, though surprising and frequently challenged, appeared to be accurate, for simps were quite happy to work fifteen hours a day and did not get bored by the most menial and repetitious tasks. So they freed human beings for human work; and on a spaceship, that was a matter of vital importance.\n```\n\n```\nUnlike the monkeys who were their nearest relatives Endeavor\u2019s simps were docile, obedient and uninquisitive.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke agree that this is the event that functioned as the 'trigger' for Jesus' death.\"[15]\n\nButler University\u00a0professor James F. McGrath explains that the animal sales were related to selling animals for use in the animal sacrifices in the Temple. He also explains that the moneychangers in the temple existed to convert the many currencies in use into the accepted currency for paying the Temple taxes.[16]\u00a0E. P. Sanders and Bart Ehrman say that Greek and Roman currency was converted to\u00a0Jewish\u00a0and\u00a0Tyrian money.[2][17]\n\nA common interpretation is that Jesus was reacting to the practice of money changers routinely cheating the people, but Marvin L. Krier Mich observes that a good deal of money was stored at the temple, where it could be loaned by the wealthy to the poor who were in danger of losing their land to debt. The Temple establishment therefore co-operated with the aristocracy in the exploitation of the poor. One of the first acts of the\u00a0First Jewish-Roman War\u00a0was the burning of the debt records in the archives.[18]\n\nPope Francis\u00a0sees the Cleansing of the Temple not as a violent act but more of a prophetic demonstration.[19]\u00a0In addition to writing and speaking messages from God, Israelite or Jewish\u00a0*nevi'im*\u00a0(\"spokespersons\", \"prophets\") often acted out prophetic actions in their life.[20][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\nAccording to\u00a0D.A. Carson, the fact that Jesus was not arrested by the Temple guards was due to the fact that the crowd supported Jesus's actions.[21]\u00a0Maurice Casey\u00a0agrees with this view, stating that Temple's authorities were probably afraid that sending guards against Jesus and his disciples would cause a revolt and a carnage, while Roman soldiers in the\u00a0Antonia Fortress\u00a0did not feel the need to act for a minor disturbance such as this; however, Jesus's actions probably prompted the authorities' decision to have Jesus arrested\u00a0some days later\u00a0and later\u00a0had him crucified\u00a0by Roman prefect\u00a0Pontius Pilate.[22]\n\n", "timestamp": 1659683066, "umap": [-0.6775290966033936, 11.883597373962402], "cluster": 22}, {"id": "Neoliberal vs NeoConservative", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/GEO-MOMENTS/Neoliberal vs NeoConservative.md", "preview": "# Neoliberal vs NeoConservative \n- Neocons\n\t- Suspect of capitalism and institutions as counter to tradition\n\t- War hawks\n\t- America First / Exceptionalism \n- Neoliberals \n\t- Deregulation, smaller gov", "full_text": "# Neoliberal vs NeoConservative \n- Neocons\n\t- Suspect of capitalism and institutions as counter to tradition\n\t- War hawks\n\t- America First / Exceptionalism \n- Neoliberals \n\t- Deregulation, smaller government\n\t- Individualism \n\t- Free International Markets \n\t- Sometimes, State Redistributive Social Programs\n\n", "timestamp": 1660433311, "umap": [-0.9634197950363159, 9.622323989868164], "cluster": 25}, {"id": "3D Authoring Ramble", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/3D Authoring Ramble.md", "preview": "# 3D Authoring Ramble\n// I disagree with BossAlex that AI will invalidate 3D authoring, because 3D placement and transforms, and framing, are not easily described in natural language \n// things must b", "full_text": "# 3D Authoring Ramble\n// I disagree with BossAlex that AI will invalidate 3D authoring, because 3D placement and transforms, and framing, are not easily described in natural language \n// things must be able to be described in natural language before they are able to precisely be put into memes or art, however, art imho comes before that which is describable.

Several union offices were occupied, their furnishings were destroyed, their documents were stolen or burned, and union members were beaten and in some cases killed; the police ignored these attacks and declared itself without jurisdiction.[2]\u00a0These early attacks occurred at random, carried out spontaneously by rank-and-file Nazis motivated by a desire to destroy \"Marxism\",[3]\u00a0and the Nazi Party leadership only implemented a general policy in May. On 2 May, 1933, trade union headquarters throughout Germany were occupied, their funds were confiscated, and the unions were officially abolished and their leaders arrested.[4]\u00a0Many union leaders were beaten and sent to\u00a0concentration camps, including some who had previously agreed to cooperate with the Nazis.[4]\n\nThree weeks later, Hitler issued a decree that banned\u00a0collective bargaining\u00a0and stated that a group of labour trustees, appointed by him, would \"regulate labour contracts\" and maintain \"labour peace.\"[6]\n\nThis decree effectively outlawed\u00a0strikes, since workers could not oppose the decisions of the trustees.[6]\u00a0Meanwhile, Robert Ley promised \"to restore absolute leadership to the natural leader of a factory \u2013 that is, the employer... Only the employer can decide.\"[6]\n\nUnder supervision of the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise, by 1936 sports and physical training were implemented in factories, and employees under the age of 18 were required to spend time in their workweek performing exercise. The Sports Office also pushed employers to build recreation facilities on work grounds, such as tennis courts, and offered tax incentives as encouragement.\n\nIts all super interesting \nthey basically raid and seize the unions and make it state controlled\nkeep wages low to boost rearmament\nbut also vouch for clean, low noise, ventilated work places, subsidized vacation programs, with the intended side effect of a physically fit populace who can be tooled for war\nand also create meaning for people by community building between classes\n", "timestamp": 1684699730, "umap": [-1.2117338180541992, 10.200093269348145], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "Human echolocation is a learned ability for humans", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/Human echolocation is a learned ability for humans to sense their\u2026.md", "preview": "# Human echolocation is a learned ability for humans to sense their\u2026\n\nHuman echolocation is a learned ability for humans to sense their environment from echoes.

This ability is used by some blind people to navigate their environment and sense their surroundings in detail. Studies in 2010[115] and 2011[116] using functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques have shown that parts of the brain associated with visual processing are adapted for the new skill of echolocation. Studies with blind patients, for example, suggest that the click-echoes heard by these patients were processed by brain regions devoted to vision rather than audition.[116]\n\n_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation_\n", "timestamp": 1684699833, "umap": [1.595777988433838, 9.975863456726074], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "AR vBus Stops", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/AR vBus Stops.md", "preview": "# AR vBus Stops\n\nAR vBus Stops\nMay 12 2023\n\nSupporting user experience of shared automated mobility on-demand through novel virtual infrastructure: Making the case for virtual stops\nFabian Hub\n_https:", "full_text": "# AR vBus Stops\n\nAR vBus Stops\nMay 12 2023\n\nSupporting user experience of shared automated mobility on-demand through novel virtual infrastructure: Making the case for virtual stops\nFabian Hub\n_https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581923000526?dgcid=rss_sd_all_\n\nThis paper focuses on the design of a vStop HMI for mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) for SAMOD use cases involving shared automated vehicles (SAVs) with ODRP operation strategies. When using SAMOD, users may find themselves in different circumstances and locations when boarding the vehicle, which may complicate the process of accessing the ride, especially in the case of occasional travel behavior. The clear and comprehensible communication of the pick-up location to the user is of great importance. In contrast to conventional bus stops, vStops can be described as pop-up events in public space. They are not marked by physical objects (e.g. signs) to draw the user's attention. In conventional ride-sharing scenarios, uncertainties between riders and drivers in pick-up situations are well-known and can be described as physical meeting problem (Hansen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010). We assume that, in the case of SAV deployment, this meeting problem could intensify and lead to irritations for users who are trying to find their booked SAV on time. Users need explicit communication of the vStop locations to overcome this physical meeting problem. Accordingly, the need for an HMI to support the user along the user journey derives.\n\n", "timestamp": 1685897122, "umap": [0.16226015985012054, 7.456292152404785], "cluster": 19}, {"id": "Duplex Theory  - That volume and time between rece", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/Duplex Theory  - That volume and time between reception at each ear\u2026.md", "preview": "# Duplex Theory  - That volume and time between reception at each ear\u2026\n\n# Duplex Theory  - That volume and time between reception at each ear are used for sound localization \n", "full_text": "# Duplex Theory  - That volume and time between reception at each ear\u2026\n\n# Duplex Theory  - That volume and time between reception at each ear are used for sound localization \n", "timestamp": 1685902830, "umap": [1.6348896026611328, 9.868816375732422], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "African Development", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/GEO-MOMENTS/African Development.md", "preview": "# African Development \nChristina Seyfried, Ph.D Yale\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMCF2eu1D0E&t=1s\n\nTODO: define poverty trap \n\n- Decolonization (Failed) -> Import Substitution Industrialization (F", "full_text": "# African Development \nChristina Seyfried, Ph.D Yale\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMCF2eu1D0E&t=1s\n\nTODO: define poverty trap \n\n- Decolonization (Failed) -> Import Substitution Industrialization (Failed) -> Neoliberal Washington Consensus (Failed in 2008 due to capital shortages) -> Poverty Trap (?)\n- Modernization Theory -> Growth leads to strong institutions \n\t- but what leads to growth?\n- // TODO: Ang 2016 How China Escaped the Poverty Trap\n- World Bank and Chinese Loans as of 2019 are at parity - world bank loans have strings\n- African States don\u2019t want African Union troops inside their borders, so china can play intermediary role \n- Nigeria\n\t- Elites try to control economy with one sector, grant access, diversification decreases elite oligopoly power \n\t- Nigeria actually **deindustrialized** after discovering oil in the 1980s\n\t- Dutch Disease -> as revenues increase, currency becomes more valuable, makes exports harder.

Management: Long Tail Dev Patterns and UX\n- Long tail effects on development patterns given Apple Vision Pro \n- Required skillsets for post Apple Vision Pro apple development\n- From UX Perspective\n\nSlide 2 Target: James: Android Native and Unity \n- Android vs Unity \n\t- Most likely android with GLTF elements\n\t- but possibly unity from the start if 3D is that important \n\nSlide 1: Target: Management: Long Tail Dev Patterns and UX\nSlide 2: Target: James: Unity and Android Native \n\n**General** \n- Windows, Volumes, and Spaces (Immersive Full Spaces)\n\t- When a space is activated, it hides other apps \n\t- Immersive Space can be full, progressive (partial), and mixed (reality)\n\t- Need Full Spaces access for app to use world geometry\n- Anchors remain persistently for different physical locations\n\t- World persistence is a system service \n\t- Plane Anchor Detection, and are classified (door, windows, etc)\n\t- Polygonal Mesh Anchors, and are classified (tv, cabinet, seat,  etc)\n- 100 meters positional accuracy, but if iphone is nearby, you get iPhone level location tracking \n- \"Ornaments\" toolbar outside app window for usability \n\n**Privacy**\n\n- For privacy reasons, dev only get access to which element is being looked and interacted with, rather than where eyes are at all time\n\n**Native**\n\n- Rendering \n\t- Shared space shares rendering with other apps \n\t- When using Metal directly, use can bypass render server and send directly to compositor \n- Apps\n\t- Typology of Apps that run as \"Windows, Volumes, or Immersive Full Spaces\"\n- Anchors / Location\n\t- World persistence is a system service - Anchors Remain persistent in different locations \n\t- Having an iPhone nearby increases location accuracy, otherwise 100m\n- Plane Anchor Detection, and are classified (door, windows, etc)\n- Polygonal Mesh Anchors, and are classified (tv, cabinet, seat,  etc)\n- Good spatialized audio, along with visual aids, adds a lot to floating VR interaction \"missing haptics\"\n\n**SharePlay **\n- Group Immersive Spaces (Share Context w/ Personas)\n\n- Can share any window (\"like MacOS\")\n- Spatial Persona Templates (Seating Arrangements)\n\t- Surround (Tabletop)\n\t- Conversation (Background)\n\t- Etc\n- Shared Context Window can have individual personal windows into shared context app \n\n**Safari**\n\n- Utilizes accessibility ARIA metadata for eye selection \n- Require some finessing of CSS tag organization for perfect selection bounds\n- Uses embeds of usdz 3d models into html\n- Suggesting supportive of WebXR / WebGL stacks\n\n**Design Guidelines **\n\n- Recommend watching video\n\t- https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10073\n\n- Utilize depth appropriately \n\t- keep \"main\" depth static\n\t-  when window pops up, keep in same plane but move main window backwards\n- Avoid design that draws eyes to edges\n\t- Round shapes \n\t- Avoid Thick outlines \n\n**Unity **\n\n- Shaders (Shader Graph)\n- Materials, sprites, meshes, all auto translated to RealityKit \n- Physically based shader convert directly \n- Occlusion, Unlit Shaders \n- Custom materials made in shader graph are converted to MaterialX\n- Play to device (decreases dev time)\n- Volume Camera \n- Xcode integration, build to device or simulator in Xcode (like iOS dev)\n- URP support foveated rendering \n- \"Hand written shaders are not supported, but can be sent to a render texture -> \"shader graph\" -> RealityKit\n- \"Volume Camera\" takes a region and adds it to Shared Space\n\t- May need some back faces for meshes clipped by volume camera\n- Support built in Unity \"Hands\" package\n- Suggestions \n\t- Start using 2022\n\t- Use ShaderGraph\n\t- Adopt URP\n\t- Start using Input System package\n\nConclusions ===========\n- Ecosystem Synergy \n\t- Focus on eye tracking seems like no-brainer for integration on other Apple platforms \n\t\t- Also sig more convenient than other XR input methods (consistently been a bar to XR input usage)\n\t- iPhone location service \n- Opinionated UX framework \n\t- better development for end user, given XR is non-standard",

"full_text": "# Lateen replacement of square rig\n\n**Lateen replacement of square rig**\n**\n**\nIt is a widespread misconception that the lateen rig replaced square rig because of better windward performance and greater manoeuvrability. \n\nA study of the relative effectiveness of the two shows that their performance was actually very similar. These results apply both when working to windward and when sailing downwind. (Furthermore, differences in performance are derived as much from the hull shape as the type of rig.) It is concluded that there was no evolutionary technological development that gave improved sailing performance in the 5th century AD change from the Mediterranean square rig to lateen, and that factors other than windward performance must have dictated this change.[26]\n\nThe Mediterranean Square Rig underwent a simplification in the 5th century AD, with reduction in the number of components. Most obviously, in the archaeological context, this included the absence of brails (and the distinctive lead rings through which these ropes were led). This change is suggested to be on cost grounds, both reducing the expense of a new build and of ongoing maintenance. This would have given some degradation of performance of this type of square rig. Lateen was already available as an alternative and, having fewer component parts, could compete on cost but maintained the performance of the original Mediterranean Square Rig. This coincided with innovation in hull construction methods as the edge-to-edge joining of the hull planking with pegged tenons (a \"shell first\" construction technique) started to be replaced with the early evolutionary phases of \"frame first\" carvel construction. This is also suggested to be driven by costs. Therefore the change from square rig to lateen at the in the 5th century is considered to be driven by construction and maintenance costs, not by any significant difference in sailing performance.[27]\n", "timestamp": 1692002043, "umap": [-1.070330262184143, 11.401103973388672], "cluster": 21}, {"id": "schools and the share of centi-millionaires that g", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/PARENTING/schools and the share of centi-millionaires that graduated from each\u2026.md", "preview": "# schools and the share of centi-millionaires that graduated from each\u2026\n\nschools and the share of centi-millionaires that graduated from each:\nHarvard University - 7%\nMassachusetts Institute of Techno", "full_text": "# schools and the share of centi-millionaires that graduated from each\u2026\n\nschools and the share of centi-millionaires that graduated from each:\nHarvard University - 7%\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology - 5%\nStanford University - 5%\nUniversity of Pennsylvania - 4%\nColumbia University - 4% \nYale University - 4% \nCornell University - 3% Princeton University - 3% \nOther - 65%\n", "timestamp": 1692002791, "umap": [-0.7177907228469849, 8.463926315307617], "cluster": 20}, {"id": "Driverless shouldn\u2019t equal meaningless- creatives ", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/Driverless shouldn\u2019t equal meaningless- creatives can unlock the user\u2026.md", "preview": "# Driverless shouldn\u2019t equal meaningless: creatives can unlock the user\u2026\n\n**Driverless shouldn\u2019t equal meaningless: creatives can unlock the user experience **\nAnthony Pond\nhttps://aew.cir-mcs.i.merce", "full_text": "# Driverless shouldn\u2019t equal meaningless: creatives can unlock the user\u2026\n\n**Driverless shouldn\u2019t equal meaningless: creatives can unlock the user experience **\nAnthony Pond\nhttps://aew.cir-mcs.i.mercedes-benz.com/articles/driverless-shouldnt-equal-meaningless-creatives-can-unlock-the-user-experience/\n\nAsahi Kasei Europe\u2019s survey from 2020 reaffirmed this growing trend, with 56.9% of respondents stating connectivity features as an essential part of their next car purchase.

Given the potential slowing of moores law, it feels like these kind of parallel processors are going to be very important for a long, long, time. \n\nHOWEVER, everyone is jumping on the 'AI' train in the LLM sense, and there is an overestimation of it's potential use cases and applications. I don't think it will replace as many jobs as the media is piping up.  The only reason LLMs work is because the internet provided a relatively structured limitless NLP data source, that does not apply to all of the really valuable uses for AI, such as highly specific skill niches and the computer vision approaches nvidia researches. For that you need more 3D visual data, and for that you need more relatively high-marginal cost (compared to internet/software) networked camera hardware in the world, which we do not yet have.

For example the hypothetical parts of the universe moving away faster than the speed of light from us, and thus outside our causal event horizon.

However I do not think they can be innate to the object, nor is reasonable to consider the value of variables with which we can never interact and/or perceive. Similarly, on a metaphysical level it may be useful to conceptualize the world in Berkeley's subjective idealism as well, particularly the concept of a infinite mind or God, because it allows finite beings to understand the possibly infinitely large and infinitely small reality. \n\n  \n\nLastly, I think it is more arrogant to assume that the world exists as we perceive it, because we don't currently know who else might be perceiving it, and possibly differently.

It seems the long empires are ones that spread along climate similar zones, and be able to fight off those with limited resources from climate north and climate south, that try to steal their resources, as well as the installment of common creation myth, a sort of cultural imperative and justification, to those in the empire. Empire consolidations and the culmination of long wars seem to oddly correlate with max derivative of climate models (most absolute slope between min and max) (ww2/European union, first rise of Rome, fall of Rome, the crusades, Hundred Years' War) I suppose when people have enough resources and are confident being chancy)\\]\n\n  \n\nThe greatest empires, and the greatest individuals, are those that have the elasticity to do both: individual and collective, past and future. \n\n  \n\nWe must look inside ourselves on par with where we look without. \n\n  \n\nJews, look inward to their small community, to a messiah that exists of them, as they do not claim a real homeland. Large connected families are an emergent property of resource poor merchant tribe cultures (post Rome Italian states). They master themselves, each other, and external society values them due fully if enviously (Genoese mercenary crossbowmen). They have been ironically looked down upon due to their apparent disregard responsibility of loyalty to the land where they are living\n\n. \n\n  \n\nThe Christians and muslims creation myth is to look to external messiahs from a past and distant lands. Harsher climates, or more likely to hit by changes in climate (father from temperate bands) reduce resources and they fight amongst themselves till some are fed up, take their family or themselves, and move to another climate zone, where they must interact and feel the need to breed with new people (Neanderthals, Modern Swedes). \n\nSignificant interbreeding reduces the value of the family unit. Their creation myth is we came here from a far away land and took what it had, and had sex with the locals. \"Whites\" fortunately had many period of distant war with very different cultures wherein \"white\" power centers were not destroyed by winning or losing the war, (Carthage, ww2, the crusades, colonialism, roman war with Greeks, roman Egypt, Cold War, Vietnam War) each of which empowered and fueled technological and cultural innovation of \"white\" society. \n\n  \n\nThe Sinos, initially a more tribalistic warring society, have in their creation myth in family / tribe, and thus the past, as their tribe, starting during the first consolidation (Confucianism at end of first Chinese warring states period, pre BC, Tokugawaism after the similar but distant Japanese sengoku jidai), rapidly changed towards looking inward, finalizing with the reconsolidation of China in the Song Dynasty and the collapse Rome and of east west trade. Coincidently (or not) Buddhism, inward looking, expands in this time period.

People wear some sort of bone/air conducting open ear headphone daily, slightly smarter voice assistant, daily scheduling, slightly better object and location recommendations, that you truly feel like you picked yourself (maybe you did, maybe it was the algo you never can tell). These cheap ubiquitous style of headphones include 3D scanners and head trackers, mapping the world and editing together curated moments from your life. The internet is no longer seen as a collection of html pages, but a backbone for silos / walled gardens. Congress has enacted more technology standardization bills but they can\u2019t keep pace. There still is no unified messaging or voice chat protocols. Lots of smart objects, and the price of integrating sensors and some form of tracking into non electrical and wirelessly charged objects has plummeted. Shoes, bottles, mugs, beds, cars, toilets, laundry bottles, delivery boxes. A new set of large tech companies has emerged among the stalwarts based on a combination of smart objects, decentralized data storage networks related to crypto, information classification and categorization, and 3D mapping. Almost all objects have 3D representations, many are made on the fly. Kids learn 3D modeling and programming in elementary school. Like photoshop and iMovie enabled our generation, in this age 3D viral content (\u201cmemes\u201d) are abundant. Having a \u201cdrone delivery box\u201d (of varying sizes from mailbox to shipping container) is common sight on curbs. Sweatshops have taken off in Africa, India and China solidify as the worlds manufacturing centers after the completion of the Chinese Belt and Road. Chinese have initiated at least one minor counterinsurgency in Africa and or Micronesia. The \u201cMaker\u201d zeitgeist has faded, and most are starting to see the health effects of being exposed to chemicals during their youth. Things are manufactured \u201clocally\u201d in the same way Amazon warehouses exist on the urban periphery. The price of shipping has remained static given global regulations against oil burning cargo ships and the natural tendency to decrease over time. The northwest passage is open for most of the year and Chinese shipping flows to the US and Europe. The United States is trying to get its shit together and has a few offshoring developments in Africa, South America.\n\nDrugs have been slowly moved towards legalization and regulation \n\nI watched this great video essay about how films are clearly made by filmmakers. Basically it argued that a lot of plots in movies made by industrial Hollywood reflect the emotions and power structures dealt with during the creation of a movie. In this same way, I feel like voice assistants are pushed by the tech illiterate who only are used to spoken natural language, and the nerds who wear glasses and wish deeply for everyone else to think wearing glasses was cool or at least normal. \n\nRealistically nobody wants things on their face.

Fabs\nQoura\nArizona has pretty much everything a semiconductor fab needs: modern infrastructure, predictable weather, relatively loose environmental controls especially for volatile organic compounds, VOC, and a well trained work force with relatively low cost of living (1/3 the cost for housing as compared to California).\nBut there is one key reason and that is sodium chloride\u2026 salt, or the lack of it. Arizona is far away from the ocean and from any chance of an event that brings salt air anywhere near the fab. Salt is bad for a silicon fab even in minute quantities. The weather is good in the sense that there is a fairly steady external ambient. Yes, the temperature in Arizona changes by 30 degrees from day to night (as compared to 5 degrees in silicon valley) and it does get very hot but the average temperature stays in a manageable range throughout the year and there are very few freezes which don\u2019t last long.\nAs for humidity, the humidity in a cleanroom is controlled to about 35%. This is the ideal humidity for silicon fabrication especially for photoresist and reduces the incidence of static charge buildup and discharge.\u00a0*Low humidity*\u00a0is actually a problem in the cleanroom. A cleanroom will shut down with humidity below 25% to prevent damage from static discharge. If low humidity is a steady condition\u00a0*external*\u00a0to the fab, like in Arizona, then the fab has systems in place to control it. In fact, the enemy of fabs are large changes in external humidity. Santa Ana winds are horrible for fabs on the Pacific coast of California. Humidity goes from 60% to 10% overnight. No environmental system can handle that gracefully. There are no large Silicon fabs there because of the salt but there are plenty of smaller fabs that process materials not as sensitive to salt. Sub freezing weather is also bad for fabs in most of the United States (cold air has very little moisture). Again, a large change in external humidity from day to night that goes along with the temperature change really messes up the fab\u2019s environmental controls. All of this can be engineered but it costs money: bigger air handling systems, bigger humidifiers, more energy.\nArizona weather is reasonably stable especially in well insulated dwellings. Internal conditions can be controlled with enough energy. There is plenty of solar energy available if the fab wants to go that route. Infrastructure is good. A fab needs sophisticated supplies from all over the US. A fab can\u2019t afford weather disruptions to deliveries, power and water. I doubt that a shipment of chemicals to Arizona has ever been interrupted by weather. I think the water supply is fairly steady and reliable.\nAs I said at the beginning, Arizona has pretty much everything a semiconductor fab needs: modern infrastructure, predictable weather, relatively loose environmental controls, a well trained work force with relatively low cost of living and\u2026 no salt in the air!\n", "timestamp": 1709495074, "umap": [0.7002794742584229, 7.06193733215332], "cluster": 10}, {"id": "Virtual Production II", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/Virtual Production II.md", "preview": "# Virtual Production II\n- creator can now control camera angles,    VUZIX Google glass, ai , voice commands, face filters \n\n// thoughts \n// Unreal + tracked lights + Tracked Camerqs + AR actor puppet ", "full_text": "# Virtual Production II\n- creator can now control camera angles,    VUZIX Google glass, ai , voice commands, face filters \n\n// thoughts \n// Unreal + tracked lights + Tracked Camerqs + AR actor puppet control + virtual production overlay, virtual production for exciting meetings \n\n// Consumer Product vs Creator Tools, \n\nCreator/Influencer Tools vs Accessible Mass Authorship Tools \n\n// Consumer applications filters (snap) make recognizable memetic tropes  \n\n# sACN Ethernet lighting protocol \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t light with the wall\u201d\n", "timestamp": 1710725101, "umap": [0.4523108899593353, 8.030898094177246], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "San Francisco, Exodus of Agile", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/San Francisco, Exodus of Agile.md", "preview": "# San Francisco, Exodus of Agile\n\nSan Francisco, Exodus of Agile \nMar 24 2024\nIts clear to me what will happen.

Defense tech, friend-shoring, taking the learning from bay philosophy and transmitting them across the world (no I do not mean the leftism, I mean the software equivalent of Ford's production line. Im 100% certain this will be taught in kids books the same way we are today taught about Ford's line.). This is likely similar to the kinds of process / organizational innovation that happened in the Detroit factories. Software process innovation seems to have really reached an apex, and now it needs talent export. Especially given tech companies are trying to reduce labor costs (and with AI they may be able to reduce engineering costs), it only makes sense for a large exodus of software engineers redistributing across the United States.

However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, the \"Little Ice Age\" had reached intense levels in Greenland.[26] Excavations of middens from the Norse farms in both Greenland and Iceland show the shift from the bones of cows and pigs to those of sheep and goats.

I would add that real happiness exists in a lasting way only at the deepest level of your mind, which is naturally and unconditionally happy. Material goals can be only temporarily satisfying. That's why people keep wanting more and more; they hope they will be satisfied. \"If I get another car, maybe I'll be happy.\" So they keep getting more cars and more cars. Or more electric guitars; some people have literally several dozen guitars. Or more real estate. Or a different wife or girlfriend. All these things can be pleasing in the short run, but then the hunger for happiness is active again, and people look for things that will satisfy it.\n\nPerhaps the preceding comments will cause you to develop different or bigger material goals. If so, you will always be wanting more. Even billionaires want more billions.\n\nPerhaps your current feeling of frustration and disappointment results from recognition of this truth. On some level, you know material gains are only temporarily satisfying, and you want to know what else can be done.\n\nFor me, the answer is contacting the quietest level of my mind every morning and every evening. This quiet mental state leads to a quiet physical state of the body, and I get rest that is deeper than I get after hours of sleep. It's enjoyable, but the best part is that afterwards, some of the happiness that exists at the quietest level of the mind stays with me when I am in activity, so I am happier. The deep rest causes stress to be released from the body and the nervous system, so I am healthier. And my thinking is improved, so I am more productive. When I started doing this, I was not focused on long-term goals. I was just trying to have fun in the evenings and on weekends. Expecting to remain in the business world, I knew I needed an MBA, but I just didn't want to do the work. After a while, my thinking and motivation naturally improved, and I decided to earn the MBA. A few years later, I decided I wanted to be a management professor, and I entered and completed a PhD program. Then, I worked as a professor for over 20 years before retiring earlier this year. I doubt that I would have entered graduate school if I had not learned Transcendental Meditation. It remains a daily source of happiness and amazement for me, and I have been doing it for over 40 years. It's easy. It does not involve concentration. It allows the mind to naturally become quiet, something that is not elusive. If you can run, you have the ability to stand still. Similarly, if you can think, you can experience a quiet mind. Only the right technique is needed. TM is a reliable way to have this experience, and people often report their very first meditation with TM was a new and wonderful experience.\n\nPracticing TM, you take happiness with you into activity, and all your activities become more satisfying. I expect that you would finally identify goals that would lead to greater satisfaction for you, and you would enjoy them more because of the happiness you develop in meditation.\n\nIf this sounds at all interesting, I suggest you go to the website\u00a0[Learn about the Transcendental Meditation technique.](http://tm.org/)\n\n  \n\nYou may be on the threshold of a phase in your life that is better than you ever thought possible.\n\nBest wishes.\n```", "timestamp": 1726477280, "umap": [0.9269896745681763, 9.818317413330078], "cluster": 11}, {"id": "Reality in Fiction - Violence", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Reality in Fiction - Violence.md", "preview": "# Reality in Fiction - Violence\nREALITY IN FICTION MEDIA - VIOLENCE\n\nNo Date\n\nAre we above our interests?\n\n  \n\nIt is more dangerous to assume than to question. \n\n  \n\nThe skeptical viewpoint on this to", "full_text": "# Reality in Fiction - Violence\nREALITY IN FICTION MEDIA - VIOLENCE\n\nNo Date\n\nAre we above our interests?\n\n  \n\nIt is more dangerous to assume than to question. \n\n  \n\nThe skeptical viewpoint on this topic would be to challenge the assumption that media does not influence us.\n\n  \n\nThe underlying question is about the influence our media has on our actions, and if our brains differentiate reality and fiction to the extent that it does not influence our behaviours.\n\n  \n\nThe very nature of the mass adoption of narrative media should be enough to explain, as well as the ability for one to interact with a film television show or game. \n\n  \n\n**The brain does indeed value the real greater than the fictional**\n\nSixty male subjects were either attacked or treated neutrally by a confederate, after which each saw a videotape of two men fighting. Subjects were informed that fight was either real or fictitious or were given no explanation of it. Subjects who had previously been attacked and had observed the fight under a set to perceive it as real were subsequently more punitive in their treatment of the confederate than subjects in all other conditions. The combination of prior attack and observation of real violence also sustained blood pressure (BP) at near the level produced by the attack, whereas BP of attacked subjects in the other conditions declined during the time the fight was observed. Palmar sweat measures revealed that observation of real violence was more arousing than observation of fictitious fighting.

So the response would be\u00a0_I hear you five by five_ for a perfect signal, or\u00a0_I hear you five square_. In many, many cases in fox mike when you are in a hole or very close to being out of range, the response might be\u00a0_four by two_, meaning that the signal is fairly strong but its intelligibility is very weak.\n\n  \n\n_Jumping Jack_\n\n  \n\n_Wait-out_ meant I was very busy, you are my lowest priority, and I will call you back, so quit bothering me. Occasionally, when someone is stepping on your communications,\u00a0_Get the F--- off my net, this is a denied frequency!_ Then the ASA (I think that was their initials) would file a complaint which went nowhere, either that or it is still in the processing queue.\n\n  \n\nPsyops\n\nThere was a second lieutenant at 3d Mobile, Long Hai, Vietnam. He headed up S-5 duties in the area. During a break following a mortar attack he was out at the bunker wall with a bull horn, with the assistance of an interpreter, attempting to encourage our enemy to surrender. In response, our enemy shipped us a couple more truckloads of 82-mm. The poor\u00a0_2nd-Lt_\u00a0never heard the end of it.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\[MPC (Military Pay Currency was preferred over Pia (Piastres). I believe that equivalent was $10-MPC = 1000-Pia. The legal exchange rate was roughly 1500-Pia to $10-MPC. But on the black market the fluctuation would be much greater, as it could go as high as 3.5 to 1.\n\n  \n\nTrading MPC for Piastres on the blackmarket was definitely illegal, but would not be treated as high treason. However, Greenbacks (the US Dollar) which traded for up to 3 to one MPC, and 10 to one Pia on the blackmarket could land you in Federal Military Prison.\\]\n\n  \n\n\u00a0Some used their alcohol and tobacco rations to buy the items at the PX, then sell them on the black market. American booze and cigarette (particularly menthol flavored) sold for a very high price on the black market. Every street vendor had a couple of American brand cigarette packs for sale, which was worth anywhere from 2 to 5 times the Post Exchange price.\n\n  \n\nVung Tau could be dangerous at night, but not from VC. The slang for gang-bangers or thugs was\u00a0_Cowboys._\u00a0Cowboys would roll drunk Americans for MPC. Sometimes a GI would be killed, just like in Los Angeles, California, or New York City. Another good buddy\u2014callsign Flex\u2014loved to bait Cowboys by pretending to be drunk.\n\n  \n\nA klick or so, maybe two outside the compound was an A-Camp.

As the rounds hit, sparks would fly out\u00a0_white, then red then out,_\u00a0just like a fireworks display at Disneyland. It seemed to be about the same time every night, around 10-ish (22:00).\n\n  \n\nThe PRC-46 had the option to connect to an electronic scrambling device. However, this type of scrambling was not practical for use by units in the field, on the move.\n\n  \n\n**_How the enemy could screw with us via radio:_**\u00a0As mentioned previously, all the enemy needed was the frequency\u2014not the actual radio\u2014for the purpose of screwing with troops.\n\n1.  Jamming was very common, not only by our enemy, but also by friendly troops walking over another\u2019s transmission. Line of sight\u2014FM\u2014communications was\u00a0_simplex_\u00a0meaning that unlike a telephone, two radios within range of each other could not transmit at the same time. Depending upon the strength of the signal, when two or more radios try to talk at the same time, you would hear a loud squeal.

The idea of emergent properties is also something tied directly with comprehending the seemingly directed randomness of evolution. An actionable solution then would be to demonstrate at a young age the existence of emergent properties\n\n**As a core element of early education**\nProbably one of the famous ones would be demonstrating centrifugal force with a bucket of water and asking the students how they think it works\n\n**As attributing events to individuals**\nId imagine living in a less populated area like a rural zone probably also predisposes you do believing in the will of individuals over the emergent will of the horde, or like a belief in a humanistic deity \n\n**As attributing intention to convergence or emergence**\n// What do you call something that has been emergently designed?\nalso conspiracy thinkers devalue the concept of convergence (in thinking and evolution) and attribute it to one grand narrative or direct lineage (ancient architects)\n\nyou can see this directly in the \"one global civilization that built all the megalithic stone sites across the world\" meme perpetuated by Joe Rogan and people he brings on\n\nIt couldn't possibly be that humans with similar tools and environments converge on methods and reasons for building stone architecture\n\nComparing it back to evolution, there's so many instances of animals that converged on traits based on having similar niche in food web, even from extremely distantly related animals.

One day, the school tractor was coming through the field and got stuck in one of the covered trenches, putting an end to that summer. There was some scrap wood sitting around in the corner, and I was making a miniature version and thinking how could he of accomplished something so large, and how could he have hidden it. My father was working on closing up an old gate that led to the riverside, where people took tea, a path that was long forgotten public space. \n\n  \n\nSuddenly on the other side of the fence, a large creature, something I had never seen before or since, like a giant bird, an ostrich but with green and yellow head feathers and a white body, neck snapping into action to quickly nibble the insect in the dirt.\n\n  \n\nA man on the other side of the gate, also using the quarantine time to build up his gardens and fences, noticed us, enraged. He also noticed the bird, and explained he had seen these before. It snapped at him and he recoiled, but got it to escape back into the bush. What are you doing he said, I was just about to fix this. My father explained that this gate hadn\u2019t been used in decades, but the other man explained that he had been keeping the area leading up to the gate clear to one day repair the gate. This was a large two door gate, with a trellis above it, and black cast iron hardware, with old growth wood faded but lasting the test of time. To end the bickering, I said to the man that we didn\u2019t know you wanted to use it, and we would stop. He smiled, and agreed. I crawled through the hole in the wall leading back to the river path, got stuck and had to be pushed out, hit some old barbed wire with my face, but other than that, we walked back to grandmothers mid century, no AC, rough rock and palm and cloudy yellow bottle glass, lobby house. \n\n  \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t know why my father was trying to board up those holes in the fence and gate.

This opposition was a low-level insurgency that made little headway until 1940. In 1940, German forces overwhelmed France, occupied Northern France and established the puppet Vichy French government in Southern France. The Japanese, allies to the Germans, had their allies force the Vichy French to allow Japanese troops to occupy Indochina. In 1944/45, with German forces being expelled from France and Vichy French officials in Indochina talking the Allies, Japan took over Indochina and interned the French. \n\nNow, because the Viet Minh, headed by Ho Chi Minh, were fighting against the Japanese -- as well as the Vichy French -- the United States sent OSS agents, the forerunner of the CIA, into North Vietnam to assist Ho. Ho was impressed by the OSS agents and they were impressed by his organization, which they described, and maybe accurately, as more nationalist than communist in nature. Ho requested that the OSS provide him with a copy of the American Constitution and Declaration of Independence. He then wrote a constitution for an independent Vietnam based -- at least in part -- on those documents. When Japan was defeated in 1945, Ho declared Vietnam independent. Many OSS agents believed and campaigned for the United States to recognize an independent Vietnam. \n\nIt's amazing how much impact global politics in Europe impacted Vietnam in these years. France, though, wanted Indochina back. They threatened to ally themselves with the Soviet Union if their pre-war colonies, including French Indochina, were not returned to them. And so the U.S. abandoned Ho Chi Minh in 1946. In 1954, Viet Minh beat the French at Dein Bein Phu, an isolated post in North Vietnam, and forced the French to leave the country. By then, geo-political events had turned against a now fully Communist Ho Chi Minh. And, under the dictates of the Cold War domino theory, which stated that if one nation in a region fell to Communism, then all nations would eventually fall, the United States became the primary supporter of the new Kingdom of South Vietnam, which quickly became the Republic of South Vietnam. Our aim, then, was to support the South Vietnam government against Communist agression in the context of a global ideological war between the United States and the Soviet Union (rarely did soldiers from the two sides exchange gunshots, although it rarely did happen in Korea, Vietnam and other hotspots). \n\nSo, as OSS agents argued in 1945/46, there were no material United States vital interests in Indochina that would cause the U.S. to automatically reject a government by Ho Chi Minh. It was the political interests the U.S. had in Europe against the Soviet Union that led it to allow France to re-establish its Indochinese colonies. And later it was the U.S. global geo-political interests -- also against the Soviet Union -- that led to U.S. support for South Vietnam. \n\nBut, Vietnam did not provide any rare resouces to American companies. We could get rubber elsewhere. Although Cam Rahn Bay has a deep, natural port, the United States did not need the base for its Asian operations and the Soviet Union never possessed a sufficent blue water navy to take military advantage of the harbor. There was no chance of a mass invasion of the United States from Vietnam, and the United States did not have that many strong allies, other than Thailand, in the area. As more and more American troops died in South Vietnam, it became harder to state a concrete vital interest that k", "timestamp": 1726542110, "umap": [-1.7841527462005615, 10.639657974243164], "cluster": 13}, {"id": "Early History of Scifi", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Early History of Scifi.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-06T02:32\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Early History of Scifi\nEARLY HISTORY OF SCIFI\nPre-Modern Science Fiction\n```\nL'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune (Comical Hi", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-06T02:32\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Early History of Scifi\nEARLY HISTORY OF SCIFI\nPre-Modern Science Fiction\n```\nL'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune (Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon) (1657) was the first of three satirical novels written by Cyrano de Bergerac, that are considered among the first science fiction stories. Arthur C Clarke credited this book with conceiving of the ramjet,\\[3\\] and being the first fictional example of a rocket-powered space flight.\n\nHe meets the Moon's inhabitants, who have four legs, musical voices, and fantastical weapons that cook game for a meal as it's shot. He also meets the ghost of Socrates and Domingo Gonsales of Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone. His discussions with Gonsales include how God is useless as a concept, that humans cannot achieve immortality, and that they do not have souls.

Despite the study\u2019s observation of low social feature use, such as sharing to facebook, the study references the social components of tracking. Some such components are commitment to brand, particularly in Nike users, competing with strangers on the app, tracking compared amongst social groups like family, friends and coworkers, and the actual physical device being worn as a talking point and representing similar held ideals. The study suggests that users only like to compete health data with complete strangers, or close social circles, rather than tertiary facebook acquaintances, or what I would call \u201cyour personal facing public\u201d. In our skit, it was between a such small social circle and the social validation of health tracking apps within a small social group as a precursor to adoption of said health tracking app.\u00a0\n\nThese social drivers are also referenced in the article, which while raising many more questions than it answers, I found contained the fascinating question of \u201cnarrative-health\u201d or the anxiety that quantified health may lead to decrease in asking \u201chow do you feel\u201d replaced instead with \u201cwhat does the data say.\u201d While I think most likely we will find balance of this in the future, I do wonder what kind of doctor-patient relationships will emerge when the data shows clear deviations from how the patient say they feel.

When the doors of the carbon monoxide chamber opened, \u201cthe bodies were thrown out blue, wet with sweat and urine, the legs covered with excrement and menstrual blood.\u201d 49 For this reason, H\u00f6ss preferred Zyklon-B:\n\nThere was no noticeable change in the bodies and no sign of convulsions or discolorations. Only after the bodies had been left lying for some time, that is to say after several hours, did the usual death stains appear in the places where they had lain. Soiling through opening of the bowels was also rare. There were no signs of wounding of any kind. The faces showed no distortion. 50\n\n For example, on one rare occasion when H\u00f6ss chose to observe the gassings through a peephole in the gas chamber door, he noticed:\n\n\"those who were standing nearest to the induction vents were killed at once. It can be said that about one-third died straightaway. The remainder staggered about and began to scream and struggle for air. The screaming, however, soon changed to the death rattle and in a few minutes all lay still.\" 53\n```\n  \nIt says too that as they built more chambers, they improved the design so the gas would disperse quicker, as to kill more instantly.\n\n ```\nA few months later, in June of 1942, Brack felt it important to remind Himmler of the potential advantages of sterilization over killing. \u201cCastration by X-rays\u2026is not only relatively cheap but can also be performed on many thousands in the shortest time.\u201d 83\n\nHaving come to this conclusion, Brack ignored it completely and continued with the following fantastic scheme: The persons to be \u201cprocessed\u201d\u2026would step up to a counter to be asked some questions or to fill out forms. Thus occupied, the unsuspecting candidate for sterilization would face the window for two or three minutes while the official sitting behind the counter would throw a switch which would release X-rays through two tubes pointing at the victim. With twenty such counters (cost: 20,000-30,000 marks apiece) 3000-4000 persons could be sterilized daily. 78\n\nDecent Germans, according to Himmler, were never unnecessarily cruel. As he said in the same speech: \u201cWe shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals.\u201d\n\nIn 1944, as Clemens Giese and Waldemar Kahler (both involved in the introduction of the November 1933 Nazi animal protection laws) noted:\n\n\"The animals protection movement, strongly promoted by the National Socialist government, has long demanded that animals be given anesthesia before being killed. The overwhelming majority of the German people have long condemned killing without anesthesia, a practice universal among Jews though not confined to them, \u2026as against the cultivated sensitivities of our society.\" 68\n\nPerpetrator perceptions over \u201chumane\u201d methods of killing might help increase our understanding of what it was that was so moderate about German anti-semitism. That is, unlike the Eastern Europeans and their barbaric pogroms where Jews were clubbed to death by the \u201cDeath-dealer of Kovno,\u201d most \u201cmoderately antisemitic\u201d Germans would only kill Jews with more \u201chumane\u201d\u2014clean, emotionally distant, and civilized\u2014methods.\n\nin Rumania even the S.S. were taken aback, and occasionally frightened, by the horrors of old-fashioned, spontaneous pogroms on a gigantic scale; they often intervened to save Jews from sheer butchery, so that the killing could be done in what, according to them, was a civilized way.\n\n  \nThe problem, however, with this moderate anti-semitism was that it stimulated a demand for a more \u201chumane\u201d and \u201ccivilized\u201d method of killing that happened als", "timestamp": 1726542112, "umap": [-1.2438417673110962, 10.459120750427246], "cluster": 15}, {"id": "Gun Ownership", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Gun Ownership.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:38\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Gun Ownership\n**Gun Ownership Thoughts**\n#guns #second-amendment #regulation #government\nI don\u2019t believe in ammo ownership, just gun owner", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:38\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Gun Ownership\n**Gun Ownership Thoughts**\n#guns #second-amendment #regulation #government\nI don\u2019t believe in ammo ownership, just gun ownership and hunting \n\nIn the case of a tyrannical government, it may be easier to source ammo then to source guns, as well as reload ammo and make your own lead bullets \n\nGovernment should not be able on a federal level to access lists of gun owners \n\nState Government should support greater psychological testing gun restrictions In certain clusters of states\n\nCertain free states should allow for current levels of freedom at the expense of mass shootings, those that disagree move away \n\nGun ownership would be supported by enemy governments anyway during a revolution or rebellion \n\nFree market determines who wants a gun and of what locations to cluster in, government regulates the enforcement of those clusters self determination \n\nNon Violent Freedom Marches work in the age of mass media and mass human societies \n\nAla the only reason for wanting a gun is a target hobby, \u2018home defense\u2019, and hunting\n\nAny other justification is bullshit \n\nOpen carry and concealed carry can be limited on a county /megaregion by county basis", "timestamp": 1726542113, "umap": [-1.7066190242767334, 10.279353141784668], "cluster": 13}, {"id": "Joepod Joe", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Joepod Joe.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:47\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Joepod Joe\n**JOEPOD**\n\nDecember 28, 2020\n\nJoepod introduced me to guierllomo, Mexican that lives in back of someones house in a shed and a", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:47\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Joepod Joe\n**JOEPOD**\n\nDecember 28, 2020\n\nJoepod introduced me to guierllomo, Mexican that lives in back of someones house in a shed and alwasy has to go home early, yet he and his brother have perfect skin\n\njoe is a 20 year old with no direction in life, was in the marine reserves and now is a guy who works at michaels", "timestamp": 1726542113, "umap": [2.7053072452545166, 9.373291969299316], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "Wicked (Theater Play)", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Wicked (Theater Play).md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:49\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Wicked (Theater Play)\n**thoughts on wicked**\n#reflection #reflection-on-media #theater-play\nmany plot holes, like lion, why does tin man a", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:49\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Wicked (Theater Play)\n**thoughts on wicked**\n#reflection #reflection-on-media #theater-play\nmany plot holes, like lion, why does tin man act differently, wheelchair girl is irrational, \n\ndoesnt scarecrow have no mind\n\nhowever, really good music and acting, overall very good play that is however irreconcile with plot holes, so dont think too hard", "timestamp": 1726542113, "umap": [0.1229175254702568, 10.379517555236816], "cluster": 18}, {"id": "Fences (Theater Play)", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Fences (Theater Play).md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:46\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Fences (Theater Play)\n**FENCES (Theater Play)**\n#reflection #reflection-on-media #theater-play\n```\nNo, you don't understand Maslow's hiera", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:46\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Fences (Theater Play)\n**FENCES (Theater Play)**\n#reflection #reflection-on-media #theater-play\n```\nNo, you don't understand Maslow's hierarchy of need. The father is consumed with maintaining the first two levels, while the son is thinking about the third. As I stated before, it was very difficult for black fathers to maintain the first two levels due to racism, etc..Because Troy was able to maintain the first two levels to some degree, the son had the luxury to start yapping about the third level (\"his emotional needs\") If you analyze the play, you can see that with each generation, as the black middle class grows, different needs are being introduced or developed. Troy was at level two (concerned about food/shelter and safety). Troy's father was at level one (concerned only about food/shelter--he cared nothing for Troy's safety, which was why Troy ran away from home). Listen to the story he tells of his own father in the play. It's scary. One can assume that Cory, being the next generation, will provide three levels of need to his son, but will fail with the fourth (he will provide food/shelter, safety, love/belonging, but won't provide esteem) and his son will probably come to him one day and asked him some \"damn fool question,\" about esteem the way Cory asked his father about \"being liked\" and the cycle of father-son relationships starts over again.\n```", "timestamp": 1726542113, "umap": [0.3548993468284607, 10.522238731384277], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "Malibu vs K1 Go Karts", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Malibu vs K1 Go Karts.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:52\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Malibu vs K1 Go Karts\n#reflection #go-kart #times-they-are-a-changing\nMALIBU\nin the middle of a warm summer suburbia\nwhen baseball was sti", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:52\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Malibu vs K1 Go Karts\n#reflection #go-kart #times-they-are-a-changing\nMALIBU\nin the middle of a warm summer suburbia\nwhen baseball was still the go to past time in a modernizing age\nand america's romance with frivolity had not yet ended\n\ngoing to K1 is not the same feeling... its a feeling of coldness and inhumanism, drenched in the sweat of elitism and adulthood.\n", "timestamp": 1726542114, "umap": [-0.08856069296598434, 9.368847846984863], "cluster": 12}, {"id": "Time around Women", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Time around Women.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:54\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Time around Women\n**Girl Feelings**\n\nI get these feelings sometimes after spending time with a girl.

What I perceive to be true will be more powerful to me than what is. This is simultaneously a human advantage and disadvantage. The show, nor I, have answers to the life question of what is truth. However, I believe if our conscious expected results do not occur, we must address the deeper truth of what we desire, our subconscious wishes.

Taking a project management class remotely also increases the difficulty level, which is probably a best practice. However I still believe the best work will be done in person, specifically in the realms of information bandwidth of physical interactions, is higher than digital currently, as well as in person accountability. Theres something primal about another human sitting across from you that demands higher levels of accountability then just the individual psyche over video chat can provide. Speaking again the higher difficulty of managing people remotely as Im sure the professor is experiencing right now, the text outlines \"Winner Practices\" which I feel should be weighed upon even more heavily for remote work. These were:\n\n\\-Clear Goals, by whom and by when\n\n\\-Grow internal project leaders\n\n\\-Streamline product delivery process \n\n\\-Always measure product health metrics\n\n  \n\nAs for benefits of virtual, it depends what is meant by benefit. The reading specifies some important areas, such as scope, time, cost and quality, that, dependent on project/organization values, would determine if virtual is a benefit. Virtual is a tradeoff for potentially decreases in cost, or as the textbook mentions potential global round the clock work, among other benefits relating to scope, time, cost, quality.\n\n  \n\nGenerally however, I think from a project quality scope physically bests virtual given the information bandwidth I mentioned previously. Furthermore, in software, if time is also a function of quality given low quality code may result in high levels of debugging, and cost is a function of time, it would seem that for cost(time(quality)), a project, at least in the development aspect of software lifecycle, will be best undertaken in person.", "timestamp": 1726542115, "umap": [0.2243162989616394, 8.120686531066895], "cluster": 19}, {"id": "Journal - 3rd Person, Blood Canon", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Journal - 3rd Person, Blood Canon.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:48\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Journal - 3rd Person, Blood Canon\n**3rd person, grenade launcher, blood canon** \n#journal #log #filmmaking #special-effects #third-person\n", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:48\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Journal - 3rd Person, Blood Canon\n**3rd person, grenade launcher, blood canon** \n#journal #log #filmmaking #special-effects #third-person\n\nBryce Build 3rd person rig\n\ntest angered barnett, kept mentioning it\n\ncame out very interesting\n\nbarnett played bro-man that helped beat up some kids\n\nbryce house grenade launcher\n\njon was afraid to shoot it at head after loud noise when it hit shed\n\nwe tried it on backs, most times it failed with a sorry plop\n\nbryce house blood canon\n\nused water fire extinguisher\n\ncoming our of mouth, our of arm, out of back of head", "timestamp": 1726542116, "umap": [-1.5114872455596924, 10.948836326599121], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "Michael's Dad, Gary Powers Professor, Jason", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Michael's Dad, Gary Powers Professor, Jason.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T01:39\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Michael's Dad, Gary Powers Professor, Jason\nMichael's Dad, History 16C Professor, Jason\n#reflection #dads\n- Michael's dad was a ocd so can", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T01:39\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Michael's Dad, Gary Powers Professor, Jason\nMichael's Dad, History 16C Professor, Jason\n#reflection #dads\n- Michael's dad was a ocd so cant change anything on desk\n\n- Francis Gary Powers - everyone hated him\n- Saved my history teacher from plane crashing in southern california\n\n- Jason story : Atm wroker lady who steal 20 bucks each time she services it\n", "timestamp": 1726542116, "umap": [0.0903293639421463, 9.819987297058105], "cluster": 18}, {"id": "Japan Trip", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Japan Trip.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:50\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Japan Trip\n**JAPAN AND KABUKI**\n#reflection #travel #japan #kabuki\n  \nWhat I learned the first day in japan\n\nSchoolgirls wear bowler hats ", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:50\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Japan Trip\n**JAPAN AND KABUKI**\n#reflection #travel #japan #kabuki\n  \nWhat I learned the first day in japan\n\nSchoolgirls wear bowler hats and schoolboys wear fisherman's hats.\n\nNever bring your luggage on the bus.

To counteract implicit bias, I would probably have the team members go through some kind of collaborative bias training, not individual bias training.\n\nRoleplay in particular is a extremely useful form of perspective taking. As the article mentioned, a diverse team was better off strictly if they had taken the perspective of their other team members. Extremely strange personal experience, relating to an improv game called Fiasco: My role in that scene was of a divorced mother at a PTA meeting where the ex husband had been tasked with bringing guacamole, and failed to do so. It was when the talking began I experienced a transcendent state where for a brief moment, I truly believed I was a divorced mother at a PTA meeting with my ex husband who forgot to bring the food (as representative of the irresponsibility which was the reason for our divorce), and felt one with the anxieties, sorrows, and painful events of that persona. Even thought it has only happened to me once, ever since then I have been a huge advocate for roleplay as a means of improving bias, seeing things from other's perspectives, and increasing empathy. If I had a choice, I would integrate roleplay highly into my team's implicit bias training.\n\nIf a team member was not working effectively in a diverse team, I would assume, as the article mentions, that the difference in values is greater than the difference in ideas, and at a certain point accept that we might need to change up the teams.\n\nLastly, it may be implied, but neither article mentioned it, and I think it worth mentioning, but \"diversity\" should also include all forms of cultural diversity, be it where you were born, what political affiliation you are, etc, where usually \"diversity\" is many times just shorthand for \"ethnic diversity.\"\n\n\n_Harvard Business Review_\n\n_Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter by David Rock and Heidi Grant_\n\n_Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable \u2014 and That\u2019s Why They Perform Better by David Rock, Heidi Grant and Jacqui Grey_", "timestamp": 1726542119, "umap": [-0.09197315573692322, 10.176119804382324], "cluster": 18}, {"id": "Genetic Health and Diet", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Genetic Health and Diet.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:59\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Genetic Health and Diet\n**GENETIC HEALTH / DIET**\n#health #diet #genetics\n\u201crace\u201d to describe health disparity in societies characterized b", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T12:59\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:01\n---\n# Genetic Health and Diet\n**GENETIC HEALTH / DIET**\n#health #diet #genetics\n\u201crace\u201d to describe health disparity in societies characterized by racial categories\n\nGeography as a basis for diet, and the future of genetic based health.\n\n```\nNo claims are made for medicine, mainly an attempt at personal trial of the methodology.

Famously lactase intolerance\n\nDifferences in populations can be attributed to \u201ca) a recent emergence of a variant that has not yet had time to spread to other populations,\u201d ie geographic separation, and \u201cb) natural selection in a specific local environment\u201d or environmental selection pressures. Two populations, with similar selection pressures and environments, along with anthropological human preferential migration patterns along similar climate zones, ie less genetic and geographic separation, are valuable insights into possible congruous ancestral mutations, informing diet and self care. \n\n  \n```\n\u201cLactase persistence is an excellent example of the influence of natural selection on allelic frequency.

Firstly, defining the term \u201creal life,\u201d much of assumed life is adulthood, as humans live on average more than 60 years of age, and thus the largest chunk of that life, the working career, is the closest we can get to the term \u201creal life,\u201d given that the term refers to human experience in broader society. What we can say is that greater than age 18-26 represents \u201cadulthood,\u201d which continues on until death in the US, on average 60 years of age. The difference being greater than 34, greater than the 18-26 years of adolescence, suggests that the majority of working career, that is working a job for monetary income / fulfillment of living expenses, composes the largest part of human existence. \n\nSecondly, in terms of average temporal human experience, the closer an experience to this center of the bell curve, the more likely they will have a grasp or perception of the baseline of human experience. This does not disparage experiences farther from the mean as \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse,\u201d simply farther from the norm of what the population in question experiences. \n\nThe example of workers on an oil rig was posited. While living on the oil rig, their population is separated from as much outward stimuli of popular culture as someone in an urban area would be exposed to. They may develop specifics their own culture and nuances only found in their population, as all populations do. What separates oil workers from office workers is that the majority of the population of the united states does not work on oil rigs. Similar to the narrative of the prisoner who must be reintegrated into society after their time, it is a corollary that the lesser degree of communication of stimulus from broader popular culture and human interaction, the farther one is the mean of human experience. \n\nWhy college and the military then, are farther from \u201creal life,\u201d is that they stray from this average human experience in both the temporary and socially. \n\nThe military, if only a non administrative role, is about 8 years (according to J), assumedly starting at 18, at which point the career of officer then begins or the soldier is reintegrated into \u201creal life.\u201d Similarly, when a college student leaves school and begins their career job, no longer supported by their parents financially, they too must enter the \u201creal world.\u201d", "timestamp": 1726542121, "umap": [0.7907304167747498, 10.696988105773926], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "Carribean and Matriarchy", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Carribean and Matriarchy.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T14:07\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:02\n---\n# Carribean and Matriarchy\n**CARRIBEAN AND MATRIARCHY - REFLECTION**\nNo Date\n#masculinity #feminism #carribean #culture #society #matriarchy", "full_text": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T14:07\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:02\n---\n# Carribean and Matriarchy\n**CARRIBEAN AND MATRIARCHY - REFLECTION**\nNo Date\n#masculinity #feminism #carribean #culture #society #matriarchy\nOne can expect a feminist backlash to this information since its basic conclusion\n\nis that women's liberation to date in the Caribbean has not been the direct outcome of\n\nwomen's assertive actions, but more the unintentional and indirect result of male conflict. But support for this conclusion is to be found in the observation that the Caribbean\n\nregion presents the interesting paradox of the ~oexistence of the greatest degree of women's\n\nliberation anywhere in t' ~ world - including North America and Europe- with the absence of any organized militant feminist movement championing the cause of women.\n\n  \n\nThe hypothesis postulated, together with evidence presented, asserts that conflicts\n\nbetween males of the different segments of Caribbean society has produced the matrifocal forms observed and the liberation of Caribbean women as an unintended consequence. The intention of the dominant group is to keep the male of the subordinate\n\ngroup marginal, and hence most of the opportunities of upward mobility made available\n\nto the subordinate group are biased in favour of females.\n\n  \n\nthe paper also mentions that this was a strategy that originated with the british\n\n  \n\nErrol Miller (1988) The Rise of Matriarchy in the Caribbean, Caribbean Quarterly, 34:3-4, 1-21, DOI: 10.1080/00086495.1988.11829430 \n\n  \n\nIt is a form of gendered behaviour, which tells us that men should be powerful, wealthy and have status.\n\n  \n\nMatriarchs were frequent in the UK before women were granted much access to or equality in the public sphere. When women had little influence in the 'public' domain' it is no wonder they would assert more influence domestically. \n\n[https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fran-hall/is-the-matriarchal-woman-\\_b\\_1462366.html?guccounter=1&guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAAD6MwYoXgL8c8rPTN\\_RlWyo2evSIiBfSV2iZ0WEirNfrQy2ZUege6tq4UJ40ayo0fYYMjGzLsZ8vBqdOJ9VWBewQxfYj9YxbUNEF8DrdVR-gEmKOpiUXtA7Ur8PdM-VddfpvAsXIix\\_v0QvbI-vaG5i16Q5t3JsNqoZdiXdtUi-o](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fran-hall/is-the-matriarchal-woman-_b_1462366.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD6MwYoXgL8c8rPTN_RlWyo2evSIiBfSV2iZ0WEirNfrQy2ZUege6tq4UJ40ayo0fYYMjGzLsZ8vBqdOJ9VWBewQxfYj9YxbUNEF8DrdVR-gEmKOpiUXtA7Ur8PdM-VddfpvAsXIix_v0QvbI-vaG5i16Q5t3JsNqoZdiXdtUi-o)\n\n  \n\n In addition, before contraception was widely available families were larger and more often poorer, necessitating a permanent figure to run the house. Thus many talented women would have found themselves excluded from the workforce and bound to the home. But it is a particular approach to running the home that makes someone a matriarch.\n\nThis means often mothers are raising children alone, or with the support of the grandmother as there are also high rates of teenage pregnancy. Related to this, are the worryingly high crime rates amongst young men. There is a heavy Christian influence, praising the strong family unit.

So while I agree that majority agreement on something is therefore what the majority believes is \u201cgood\u201d and therefore is effectively, we can not trust that there is not a pyramidal influence on the majority. \n\n  \n\nIn this sense, I most agree with Heraclitus and Plato, that everything that is perceivable is relative, and things that are absolute are imperceivable, regardless of their existence. As for the immaterial realm, such as Plato\u2019s discussion of a soul, as mentioned earlier, I believe it is useful. Concepts such as the Plato\u2019s innate idea may just be a way for us to comprehend the deterministic nature of the universe and the influence of things that string far before our comprehension, like the influence culture has on one\u2019s decision making. However, I do not believe they truly exist, beyond our own minds. However, on the subject of the innate idea, the very fact that animal studies show that animals know something essential to their own birth, such as the instinct to go towards light and swallow, such things could exist in the results of some permutation of DNA and scientifically be passed down. But things as complex as the example mentioned a tree, I am skeptical to believing our innate idea\u2019s have such resolution until we name them or learn through experience.  \n  \nMathematically, the human race is constantly approaching the infinity of absolute truth and forms, which we can never reach. Pragmatically the soul is a useful construct and can not be disproven to exist if it exists outside a perceivable realm. However, we are constantly stepping outside Plato-esque caves in an infinite series of caves, increasing our resolution of truth.  \n  \nAs a note I don\u2019t want to appear nihilistic I think it is a worthy pursuit. \n\n  \n\nI also really like the Euthyphro example because it enlightened me into realizing how relative the appeal to the authority of the gods as influence in action, in his case to determine righteousness. Pleasing to the gods sounded reasonable to me at first, but then realizing, yes that is right, the gods of greeks did quarrel and do questionable moral things. In this sense is god the right term to be used in the modern age West with all the baggage that comes with the word god?\n\n  \n\n\\---------------------------\n\nA form in Plato's metaphysical theory is an ideal thing that is independent of our reality, they do not exist in it. A form is a perfect, abstract thing like Justice or Beauty or Goodness, that are not spatial or temporal, they are immaterial. Plato considers the Form the real object and the object we interact with in our reality a shadow of the Form.", "timestamp": 1726542127, "umap": [0.37185266613960266, 11.67379093170166], "cluster": 17}, {"id": "Hinduism Brahman Atman Maya", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/Hinduism Brahman Atman Maya.md", "preview": "---\ncreated: 2021-03-07T14:30\nupdated: 2024-09-16T20:02\n---\n# Hinduism Brahman Atman Maya\n**HINDUISM BRAHMAN ATMAN MAYA**\n\nThe Atman is our true self, but not individuated from the totality.

This idealism is termed subjective because physical objects do not exist apart from some subject (mind) who perceives them. This kind of idealism stands in contrast to objective idealism , which holds that al though r eality is mental, it does exist independently of the human knower because it is a manifestation of an absolute mind. Objective idealism is usually monistic (or at least nondualistic), maintaining that there is one absolute mind and the universe is a manifestation of it Berkeley\u2019s subjective idealism, though nondualistic in the sense of asserting that all reality is mental or immaterial, is pluralistic in the sense that there are many finite minds independent of God\u2019s mind.\n\n  \n\nBerkely \n\nEmpiricism is the view that knowledge derives from sense experience and that knowledge claims are tested by reference to sense experience.

was demonstrated for a group of US and British officers at Fort Bliss, along with members of Congress and other VIPs. When the computer was activated, it immediately started aiming the guns at the review stands, causing several minor injuries as members of the group jumped for cover. Technicians worked on the problem, and the system was restarted. This time it started shooting toward the target, but fired into the ground 300 metres (980\u00a0ft) in front of the tank. In spite of several attempts to get it working properly, the vehicle never successfully engaged the sample targets. A Ford manager claimed that the problems were due to the vehicle being washed for the demonstration and fouling the electronics.[18]In a report on the test, Easterbrook jokingly wondered if it ever rained in central Europe.[15]\n", "timestamp": 1732654836, "umap": [-1.7986255884170532, 10.731912612915039], "cluster": 13}, {"id": "Lead STEM Instructor", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/INTERVIEW/Lead STEM Instructor.md", "preview": "# Lead STEM Instructor\n\nLead STEM Instructor\nLead STEM Instructor\nTechKnowHow Franchises \u00b7 Seasonal\nTechKnowHow Franchises \u00b7 Seasonal\n2012 - 2015 \u00b7 3 yrs\n2012 - 2015 \u00b7 3 yrs\nFoster City, California, U", "full_text": "# Lead STEM Instructor\n\nLead STEM Instructor\nLead STEM Instructor\nTechKnowHow Franchises \u00b7 Seasonal\nTechKnowHow Franchises \u00b7 Seasonal\n2012 - 2015 \u00b7 3 yrs\n2012 - 2015 \u00b7 3 yrs\nFoster City, California, United States\nFoster City, California, United States\n**## \n**\n\t* \t\t\u2022 Managed camp instructors and instructed students in STEAM topics such as robotics with LEGO NXT, programming logic, mechanical engineering. \n\t* \t\t\u2022 Responsible for 20+ students.

Not moonshots or make products for a blue ocean consumer.\n\nSo while there may be a mass panic 'bubble burst' - I think thats because of the public's inflated perception of big letters A and I - rather than the lack of potential profitability or lack of practical applications of the startups in the AI space.\n", "timestamp": 1756004561, "umap": [-0.5462142825126648, 8.31505298614502], "cluster": 20}, {"id": "A Thinly Veiled Insult", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/GEO-MOMENTS/A Thinly Veiled Insult.md", "preview": "# A Thinly Veiled Insult\n\nA Thinly Veiled Insult \nNapoleon and the Pope\nAug 15 2025\n\nThinly veiled insult At his coronation, Napoleon promised to send the Pope an altar, two ornate ceremonial coaches,", "full_text": "# A Thinly Veiled Insult\n\nA Thinly Veiled Insult \nNapoleon and the Pope\nAug 15 2025\n\nThinly veiled insult At his coronation, Napoleon promised to send the Pope an altar, two ornate ceremonial coaches, and a tiara. Only the tiara was delivered.[4] Tiaras traditionally weighed between 2 and 5 pounds (0.91 and 2.27 kg). The Napoleon Tiara, however, weighed 18 pounds (8.2 kg). It was also too small to fit comfortably on a human head. Some of the jewels and decoration for this tiara came from earlier tiaras smashed and stolen by the troops of the French Directory in 1798, when General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded Rome, established the Roman Republic, abolished the Papal States, and exiled Pope Pius VI. His successor, Pope Pius VII, elected in exile in Venice, had to use an improvised papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 tiara for his coronation in 1800. The tiara was a thinly veiled insult to the Pope.[5] However, the Pope thanked the emperor for the tiara by letter on June 23, 1805. He said that he intended to use the tiara for the Papal Mass on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul.[1]\n", "timestamp": 1756061292, "umap": [-0.9363266229629517, 11.79495906829834], "cluster": 21}, {"id": "\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/MEDIA/MEDIA-ARCHIVE/\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025.md", "preview": "# \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025\n", "full_text": "# \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025\n", "timestamp": 1756505276, "umap": [3.167778968811035, 9.136241912841797], "cluster": 6}, {"id": "\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/AR - FUTUR/FUTUR-ARCHIVE/\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025.md", "preview": "# \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025\n", "full_text": "# \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f REVIEWED AUG 29 2025\n", "timestamp": 1756506087, "umap": [3.202322244644165, 9.024349212646484], "cluster": 6}, {"id": "WEAPONS", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/GEO-MOMENTS/WEAPONS.md", "preview": "# WEAPONS\n\n**PSYOPS**\n\n\u00a0\"This is one of the few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion.

Some go blind from glass in their eyes.\nThis was the horrifying plan researchers at defense contractor HRB Singer developed\u00a0for the Office of Naval Research in 1967. Part of a larger program nicknamed Project Poorboy during the Vietnam War, the Pentagon funded research into methods for stopping insurgents\u00a0from moving down the\u00a0Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\n\u201cThe technique and substance recommended are not absolute,\u201d the scientists explained in a\u00a0**1968 review**\u00a0of the project. \u201c[But] they do provide a means of identifying trespassers, of causing irritation and incapacitation as time progresses without engendering cries of bacteriological or chemical warfare.\u201d\nStill, the new weapon would present its own appalling, indiscriminate and potentially deadly effects. Thankfully, the Navy never acted on the proposal.\n\nThe HRB Singer scientists were explicit in their descriptions of how the fiberglass weapon might work. The small shards would settle in treetops, plants or lie in wait on the ground. Light enough to be carried on the wind, insurgents\u00a0would have kicked up the material as they passed through the jungle.\n\u201cThe fibers pervade the extremities, clothing, eyes, and food of the infiltrator as he passes through the area,\u201d the scientists wrote in their proposal. \u201cThe infiltrator is not immediately aware of this pervasion but within a few minutes, when any activity is involved, he is physically irritated.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no effective countermeasures to this procedure,\u201d the HRB Singer team added, predicting truly shocking\u00a0results. Itchy, pus-filled sores would spring up on any exposed part of the body, especially the feet, within hours.\nBefore hitting their victims, the fibers could easily become covered with bacteria or other pollutants. Fighters could be blinded after getting the spun glass in their eyes. Scratching would only drive the splinters deeper into the skin.\nGuerrillas could inhale the \u201cfiber floss\u201d or inadvertently eat unsealed food covered with fragments. Once inside the body, the tiny bits of glass could cause ulcers or tiny cuts on the throat, stomach and intestines.\nIt\u2019d be useless\u00a0to try and pluck the glass out of clothing. Difficult to remove from the skin, the fibers would probably have been impossible to remove from areas inside the body without surgery.\n\u201cFibers which penetrate a person\u2019s skin can be removed only by a tweezer and magnifying glass or by waiting until the penetrated area becomes infected and the splinter is forced out by the infection,\u201d the report noted.\n\nThe idea behind the fiberglass bombs developed out of\u00a0desperation.\u00a0By 1968, the U.S. Navy and Air Force had already tried blowing up the Viet Cong\u2019s jungle pathways with regular bombs and using large, air-dropped mines to halt cargo trucks, but with little success.\n\nIn search\u00a0for a solution, the Pentagon looked at more exotic options like artificially increasing rainfall,\u00a0**dumping chemicals**\u00a0to gum up dirt roads and building\u00a0**an electronic fence**\u00a0that would warn American jets\u00a0of guerrilla activity.\u00a0The Air Force\u00a0and the U.S. Army both tried dropping\u00a0**huge tear gas bombs**\u00a0to make specific zones uninhabitable. Navy\u00a0scientists considered using nonlethal bacteria or\u00a0**glowing chemicals**\u00a0to mark individuals passing through insurgent-controlled territory.\nBut as the HRB Singer team explained, these compounds might cause an international incident no matter how safe they might be in the end. Despite mixed results in combat, tear gas proved to be a focal point for criticism both in the United States and abroad.\n\u201cMost remarks have been highly critical and give the impression that these munitions have had wides", "timestamp": 1756523488, "umap": [-1.8426836729049683, 10.756937980651855], "cluster": 13}, {"id": "TRAVEL TIERS", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/TRAVEL/TRAV-ARCHIVE/TRAVEL TIERS.md", "preview": "# TRAVEL TIERS \nTIER 1\n- Shanghai - Taipei Chinese Immersion Trip\n- New York City - Just To Do It \n- Barcelona Design Conference (**El Raval, Barcelona)**\n\nTIER 2\n* Milan Design Week\n* Cannes\n* Bangko", "full_text": "# TRAVEL TIERS \nTIER 1\n- Shanghai - Taipei Chinese Immersion Trip\n- New York City - Just To Do It \n- Barcelona Design Conference (**El Raval, Barcelona)**\n\nTIER 2\n* Milan Design Week\n* Cannes\n* Bangkok - Ho Chi Minh City - Singapore \n* Turkey - Greece\n* Shanghai - Seol \n\n* Taipei - Tokyo - Seoul\n* Mexico City \n* New York City\n\n* Barcelona \n* Shanghai - Seol \n* Taipei - Tokyo - Seoul\n\nTIER 3\n- **Poblacion, Manila**\n\n**# \n**\n**# \n**\n\n", "timestamp": 1757802295, "umap": [1.2501264810562134, 7.9386372566223145], "cluster": 31}, {"id": "Countries To Visit", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/TRAVEL/TRAV-ARCHIVE/Countries To Visit.md", "preview": "# Countries To Visit\n- Australia\n- India \n- Turkey\n- Peru? \n- Brazil?\n- Argentina? \n\n", "full_text": "# Countries To Visit\n- Australia\n- India \n- Turkey\n- Peru? \n- Brazil?\n- Argentina? \n\n", "timestamp": 1757802312, "umap": [2.4125523567199707, 9.196730613708496], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "In a bundle", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/REFLECTIONS/In a bundle.md", "preview": "# In a bundle \nAgainst pipes and cardboard \nPlush dog smiles up at me \nBlackout curtains for the ended fellow man \n\n", "full_text": "# In a bundle \nAgainst pipes and cardboard \nPlush dog smiles up at me \nBlackout curtains for the ended fellow man \n\n", "timestamp": 1757995422, "umap": [3.5906357765197754, 9.390951156616211], "cluster": -1}, {"id": "IDEAL UK GENTRY", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/GEOPOLHIST/IDEAL UK GENTRY.md", "preview": "**# IDEAL UK GENTRY**\nSeptember 16 2025\n\n**![IDEAL UK GENTRY](images/IDEAL%20UK%20GENTRY.png)\n**# \n\n", "full_text": "**# IDEAL UK GENTRY**\nSeptember 16 2025\n\n**![IDEAL UK GENTRY](images/IDEAL%20UK%20GENTRY.png)\n**# \n\n", "timestamp": 1758260977, "umap": [3.0881500244140625, 9.040460586547852], "cluster": 6}, {"id": "Thief of Joy", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/REFLECTIONS/Thief of Joy.md", "preview": "# Thief of Joy\nSep 20 2025\nI realize comparison is the thief of joy \n\nAla deus ex humans may want to be judged\n\nBut I think you should be very careful by whom you let yourself be judged. \n\nMay be the ", "full_text": "# Thief of Joy\nSep 20 2025\nI realize comparison is the thief of joy \n\nAla deus ex humans may want to be judged\n\nBut I think you should be very careful by whom you let yourself be judged. \n\nMay be the case of god?\n\nI was feeling pretty bad having hung out with the Nathan group who we don\u2019t share a lot in common with, which leads to judgmental feelings about the boringness of these people.\n\nThen I started watching architecture videos on IG and I felt connected again.

I feel my life degrading tho. This commuting is killing both my work output, therefore my respect, therefore my self perception. Additionally it is cutting out my personal life which used to impress people (probably long hair does not help). Good socialization this month, but below where it used to be. Sleep was also OK, but could easily be improved. Ji was gone, and yet, I found no matches online. What happened to me? Women in real life seem gravitated towards me (some, not the ones I want though). I realized this month how hard the search problem is, and you really need to organize (Be a Macher) people, build in your social leverage, and build social capital by doing things that matter to you. Also at work, I feel people perceive me as lazy - they have no idea about this commute. \n", "timestamp": 1759536845, "umap": [1.315183162689209, 8.739960670471191], "cluster": 29}, {"id": "Alien Dream", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/REFLECTIONS/Alien Dream.md", "preview": "# Alien Dream\n- inversion - the previously abandoned aestrlod -> think its gonna just be alien again, becomes the only safe haven when universe is infected - warm temps from rave \n- Surgery robot stap", "full_text": "# Alien Dream\n- inversion - the previously abandoned aestrlod -> think its gonna just be alien again, becomes the only safe haven when universe is infected - warm temps from rave \n- Surgery robot staples were infected which leads to all staples blowing up \n- Change to jellyfish like polyps \n- \n\n", "timestamp": 1759937750, "umap": [2.33162784576416, 10.032553672790527], "cluster": 3}, {"id": "Feels", "type": "text", "content": "/Users/con/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ConVault/dec132025-applenotes-export/LATER ======/REFLECTIONS/Feels.md", "preview": "# Feels\n\nFeels \nOct 8 2025 \nI feel super demotivated.

When they all love us. Maybe then we will love ourselves. \n\nIt stands to reason then, that this generation is the one that loves itself the least. Raised in a world shaking, pointing fingers at itself on the boiling pot of its own demise. The internet made them aware, and it made them old. The knowledge of jade in the eyes of old men, trapped in the soul yearning for stories of a past\u2019s distorted future. \n\nWhere then does this go. From tales of dignity of the every man, moral chocolate boxes in every end, instead we we\u2019ve the mythologized fairy tales into the real, of surveillance, tv, reels, copies of copies, portholes into NEW Reality. Reels that drape themselves in the grassroots of the latest meme but reek of intention, selection. Buy this gun. Buy this game. Buy this class. Buy this travel. Buy this ticket. Buy this sub. Then you will be sufficed you will be entertained you will be safe you will be alone you will be together you will be at peace you will be loved you will be with me you will be free then you will finally exist. \n\nI regret to be and disdain the old man, shouting at cloud for what can never turn back. I do not yearn because this is not pivotal, it does not sound. For I can only see war in our future, the war of our eyes of our time. The war for our skin was won long ago, and we were too brittle a men to resist. \n\n*Dark is my night, oh carrion flies. Swarming above the carcass. *\n\nI feel myself slipping. The path paved to the bottom of the tier list dot com is amorphous as it is painless, until one day you realize who you have become, fat, wicked, and restless. \n\n=============================================\n\nThere is only one way forward. Creative destruction. In the labs libertarians with Asian wives and haiiwain shirts in Silicon Valley built a reality in bits which transposed itself onto the real. If we could simulate X, if we could replicate X, if we could LARP X, why couldn\u2019t we just BE X?\n\nFuture scenarios. \n- subtle propaganda guised in the regalia of the latest meme. I swear I saw a Sora Branded meme that was comically about a horse yelling at a guy not to buy one cigarette brand over another. Yet it had way more shots and 3D elements than any SORA video I have seen. Could this have been stealth cigarette advertisements? If you are only seeing a few ads the content is an ad. The medium is the message. \n- Betray the poor. \n- I think I might be done with media. But also not? I yearn to be propagandized into wanting what everyone wants. And yet I detest the idea of it. I detest being like everyone else. And yet I crave it more than anything. To feel other people understand my motives, my desires. \n\nBAS is about motion, repetitive motion. Reproduction, sex, growth. Life. And the transposition of the inverse. Stone. The effigy of life scrawled into the barren material in the universe. It is about stillness of stone and the lack of stillness we can never achieve amongst the hyper real. It's about the imposition of life on rock. Of feelings onto semiconductors. \n\n**Run Club** is a high relief sculpture based on a time series video of run clubs throughout San Francisco. Shot on a hyper telephoto lens, compressing depth nearly completely. Then, using an ai model trained on images to re add depth back into the photo, and then cast in stone. \n\nThe run club is self aware, it knows what it is, and now has been filled with the same stench of club promoters. We have the keys to sex, they say behind digital bouncer doors, should you only come and find out. It is a place of relaxation, euphoria, mission, task, purpose, ritual, social maneuvering towards that real goal. \n\n**Youtube** is a medium in which no one can speak of the fact that the medium itself is the problem. It's like speaking around the issue. The elephant in the room that no one will address, the taboo, the fish that can't see water.

It doesn\u2019t compress aggressively or guess what is important. Instead, it organizes interactions into structured pages, adds metadata for efficient retrieval and generates optional lightweight summaries for quick scanning. Critically, every detail is preserved, and nothing is thrown away.\n## The researcher: A deep retrieval engine\nWhen the agent needs to act, the researcher takes the helm to plan a search strategy, combining embeddings with keyword methods like BM25, navigating through page IDs and stitching the pieces together.
